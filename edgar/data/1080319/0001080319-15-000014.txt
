Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On July 20, 2015, we entered into an investment agreement (the "Agreement") with
Tangiers Investment Group, LLC (the "Investor"), whereby the Investor has agreed
to invest up to $5,000,000 to purchase shares of our common stock.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and a registration rights
agreement, we may, in our sole discretion, deliver a notice (the "Put Notice")
to the Investor which states the dollar amount which we intend to sell to the
Investor on a certain date. The amount that we shall be entitled to sell to the
Investor shall be equal one hundred percent (100%) of the average of the daily
trading dollar volume (U.S. market only) of the Common Stock for the ten (10)
consecutive trading days immediately prior to the date which the applicable Put
Notice is delivered (the "Put Notice Date") so long as such amount does not
exceed an accumulative amount per month of $150,000 unless a prior approval of
the Investor is obtained by the Company. The minimum amount shall be equal to
$5,000. The Investor is prohibited from owning more than 9.99% of the Company's
outstanding shares would exceed as determined in accordance with Rule 13d-1(j)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In connection with the Agreement, we also entered into a registration rights
agreement dated July 20, 2015, whereby we agreed to file a Registration
Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission within thirty
(30) days of the date of the registration rights agreement and to have the
Registration Statement declared effective by the Securities and Exchange
Commission no more than ninety (90) days after we have filed the Registration
Statement.

Also, on July 9, 2015 we entered into an agreement to issue a Convertible
Promissory Note (the "Note") with the Investor with a principal amount of
$220,000 (the "Principal Sum") bearing interest at a rate of 10% per annum due
12 months after the issue date. The Note also includes an Original Issue
Discount ("OID") of 10%, of any consideration paid.

The Note is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at a price
equal to the lower of $0.80 or 60% of the lowest trading price of the Company's
common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days prior to the date on which
Investor elects to convert all or part of the Note. (the "Conversion Price").
The conversion price is subject to proportional adjustment in the event of stock
splits, stock dividends, and similar corporate events.

In connection with the Note, the Investor is prohibited from owning more than
4.99% of the Company's outstanding shares, unless the market capitalization of
the Company's common stock is less than $10,000,000, in which case the Investor
is prohibited from owning more than 9.99% of the Company's outstanding shares.

On July 21, 2015, (the "Closing Date") in consideration for the Note the
Investor delivered cash consideration of $55,000 (the "Initial Consideration")
less an OID of $5,000 for net proceeds to the Company of $50,000. In addition,
the Company paid $4,000 in commission to the placement agent related to the
transaction (the "Fees").









<PAGE>

The Company may prepay the Note in whole or in part, according to the following
schedule:

Days Since Effective Date                            Prepayment Amount
_________________________                        ________________________

      Under 30                                   100% of Principal Amount
         31-60                                   110% of Principal Amount
         61-90                                   120% of Principal Amount
        91-120                                   130% of Principal Amount
       121-150                                   140% of Principal Amount
       151-180                                   150% of Principal Amount

After 180 days from the Closing Date the Note may not be prepaid without written
consent from Investor, which consent may be withheld, delayed, denied, or
conditions in Investor's sole and absolute discretion.

In the event of a default, the Note may be accelerated by the Investor. The
outstanding balance is immediately due and payable at an interest rate of the
lesser of 18% per annum (or the maximum rate permitted by law) applied to the
outstanding balance.


Item 2.03 CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION

The total proceeds the Company received from the Note was $55,000, less the
original issue discount of $5,000 plus the Fees of $4,000. As of the date of the
Note, the Company is obligated on the Note issued to the Investor. The Note is a
debt obligation arising other than in the ordinary course of business, which
constitutes a direct financial obligation of the Company and provides for
penalties and rescission rights if Empire does not deliver shares of its common
stock upon conversion within the required timeframes.

In addition, Empire State Financial Inc. ("ESFI") of Long Island, NY served as
placement agent for the Company in the Transaction. The Company paid commissions
of $4,000 to ESFI and will issue an amount of Common Shares of the Company equal
to 6% of the aggregate Initial Cash Purchase price based upon the price of the
Common Stock as offered in the Transaction.

The Company claims an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") for the private placement of
these securities pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and/or Regulation D
promulgated there under since, among other things, the transaction did not
involve a public offering, the Investor is an accredited investor, with access
to information about the Company and their investment, the Investor took the
securities for investment and not resale, and the Company took appropriate
measures to restrict the transfer of the securities.

The foregoing descriptions of the investment agreement, registration rights
agreement and Note are qualified in their entirety by reference to such
investment agreement, registration rights agreement and Note, which are filed
as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 2.1, respectively, hereto and are incorporated
herein by reference.

                             EMPIRE GLOBAL CORP


Issuance Date:                    July 9, 2015
Total Face Value of Note:         $220,000
Initial Consideration:            $50,000
Initial Original Issue Discount:  $5,000

THIS NOTE is a duly authorized Convertible Promissory Note of Empire Global
Corp. a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of
Delaware (the "Company"), designated as the Company's 10% Convertible Promissory
Note in the principal amount of $220,000 (the "Note"). This Note will become
effective only upon execution by both parties and delivery of the first payment
of consideration by the Lender (the "Effective Date").

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the Company hereby promises to pay to the order of Tangiers
Investment Group, LLC or its registered assigns or successors-in-interest
("Holder") the Principal Sum of $220,000 (the "Principal Sum") and to pay
"guaranteed" interest on the principal balance hereof at an amount equivalent to
10% of the Principal Sum, to the extent such Principal Sum and "guaranteed"
interest and any other interest, fees, liquidated damages and/or items due to
Holder herein have been repaid or converted into the Company's Common Stock (the
"Common Stock"), in accordance with the terms hereof. Upon the execution of this
Note the sum of $50,000 shall be remitted and delivered to the Company, and
$5,000 shall be retained by the Purchaser through an original issue discount

ID is set at 10% of any consideration paid. The Holder may pay additional
Consideration to the Company in such amounts and at such dates (each, an
"Additional Consideration Date") as Holder may choose in its sole discretion.
The Principal Sum due to Holder shall be prorated based on the Consideration
actually paid by Holder (plus the "guaranteed" interest and 10% OID, both which
are prorated based on the Consideration actually paid by the Holder, as well as
any other interest or fees) such that the Company is only required to repay the
amount funded and the Company is not required to repay any unfunded portion of
this Note. The Maturity Date is one year from the Effective Date of each payment
(the "Maturity Date") and is the date upon which the Principal Sum of this Note,
as well as any unpaid interest and other fees, shall be due and payable.

Default pursuant to Section 2(a), additional interest will accrue from the date
of the Event of Default at the rate equal to the lower of 18% per annum or the
highest rate permitted by law (the "Default Rate").

This Note will become effective only upon the execution by both parties,
including the execution of Exhibits B, C and D and the Irrevocable Transfer
Agent Instructions and delivery of the initial payment of consideration by the
Holder (the "Effective Date").

This Note may be prepaid by the Company, in whole or in part, according to the
following schedule:

Days Since Effective Date                            Prepayment Amount
_________________________                         ________________________

      Under 30                                    100% of Principal Amount
         31-60                                    110% of Principal Amount
         61-90                                    120% of Principal Amount
        91-120                                    130% of Principal Amount
       121-150                                    140% of Principal Amount
       151-180                                    150% of Principal Amount

After 180 days from the Effective Date this Note may not be prepaid without
written consent from Holder, which consent may be withheld, delayed, denied, or
conditions in Holder's sole and absolute discretion.  Whenever any amount
expressed to be due by the terms of this Note is due on any day which is not a
Business Day (as defined below), the same shall instead be due on the next
succeeding day which is a Business Day.

For purposes hereof the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them
below:

"Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on
which commercial banks in the City of New York are authorized or required by law
or executive order to remain closed.

"Conversion Price" shall be equal to the lower of $0.80 or 60% of the lowest
trading price of the Company's common stock during the 20 consecutive trading
days prior to the date on which Holder elects to convert all or part of the
Note.  For the purpose of calculating the Conversion Price only, any time after
4:00 pm Eastern Time (the closing time of the Principal Market) shall be
considered to be the beginning of the next Business Day.  If the Company is
placed on "chilled" status with the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), the
discount shall be increased by 10%, i.e., from 40% to 50%, until such chill is
remedied.  If the Company is not Deposits and Withdrawal at Custodian ("DWAC")
eligible through their Transfer Agent and DTC's Fast Automated Securities
Transfer ("FAST") system, the discount will be increased by 5%, i.e., from 40%
to 45%.  In the case of both, the discount shall be a cumulative increase of
15%, i.e., from 40% to 55%.  Any default of this Note not remedied within the
applicable cure period will result in a permanent additional 10% increase, i.e.,
from 40% to 50%, in addition to any other discount, as provided above, to the
Conversion Price discount.

"Principal Amount" shall refer to the sum of (i) the original principal amount
of this Note (including the original issue discount, prorated if the Note has
not been funded in full), (ii) any additional payments made by the Holder
towards the Principal Sum (iii) all guaranteed and other accrued but unpaid
interest hereunder, (iv) any fees due hereunder, (v) liquidated damages, and

                                     - 2 -
<PAGE>

(vi) any default payments owing under the Note, in each case previously paid or
added to the Principal Amount.

"Principal Market" shall refer to the primary exchange on which the Company's
common stock is traded or quoted.

"Trading Day" shall mean a day on which there is trading or quoting for any
security on the Principal Market.

"Underlying Shares" means the shares of common stock into which the Note is
convertible (including interest, fees, liquidated damages and/or principal
payments in common stock as set forth herein) in accordance with the terms
hereof.

The following terms and conditions shall apply to this Note:

Section 1.00   Conversion.

(a)  Conversion Right.  Subject to the terms hereof and restrictions and
     limitations contained herein, the Holder shall have the right, at the
     Holder's sole option, at any time and from time to time to convert in whole
     or in part the outstanding and unpaid Principal Amount under this Note into
     shares of Common Stock as per the Conversion Formula.  The date of any
     conversion notice ("Conversion Notice") hereunder shall be referred to
     herein as the "Conversion Date".

(b)  Stock Certificates or DWAC.  The Company will deliver to the Holder, or
     Holder's authorized designee, no later than 2 Trading Days after the
     Conversion Date, a certificate or certificates (which certificate(s) shall
     be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions if the shares of
     Common Stock underlying the portion of the Note being converted are
     eligible under a resale exemption pursuant to Rule 144(b)(1)(ii) and Rule
     144(d)(1)(ii) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) representing the
     number of shares of Common Stock being acquired upon the conversion of this
     Note.  In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the shares
     of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, provided the
     Company's transfer agent is participating in DTC's FAST program, the
     Company shall instead use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
     transfer agent to electronically transmit such shares issuable upon
     conversion to the Holder (or its designee), by crediting the account of the
     Holder's (or such designee's) broker with DTC through its DWAC program
     (provided that the same time periods herein as for stock certificates shall
     apply).

(c)  Charges and Expenses.  Issuance of Common Stock to Holder, or any of its
     assignees, upon the conversion of this Note shall be made without charge to
     the Holder for any issuance fee, transfer tax, postage/mailing charge or
     any other expense with respect to the issuance of such Common Stock.
     Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees incurred from the issuance of the
     Common stock to Holder.  Any such charges related to the issuance of Common
     Stock required to be paid by the Holder (whether from the Company's delays
     or outright refusal to pay) will be automatically added to the Principal
     Sum of the Note and tack back to the Effective Date for purposes of
     Rule 144.

(d)  Delivery Timeline.  If the Company fails to deliver to the Holder such
     certificate or certificates (or shares through the DWAC program) pursuant
     to this Section (free of any restrictions on transfer or legends, if
     eligible) prior to 3 Trading Days after the Conversion Date, the Company
     shall pay to the Holder as liquidated damages an amount equal to $2,000 per
                                     -3-
<PAGE>
     day, until such certificate or certificates are delivered.  Such liquidated
     damages shall only be due in the event of an intentional delay caused by
     the Company. The Company acknowledges that it would be extremely difficult
     or impracticable to determine the Holder's actual damages and costs
     resulting from a failure to deliver the Common Stock and the inclusion
     herein of any such additional amounts are the agreed upon liquidated
     damages representing a reasonable estimate of those damages and costs.
     Such liquidated damages will be automatically added to the Principal Sum of
     the Note and tack back to the Effective Date for purposes of Rule 144.

(e)  Reservation of Underlying Securities.  The Company covenants that it will
     at all times reserve and keep available for Holder, out of its authorized
     and unissued Common Stock solely for the purpose of issuance upon
     conversion of this Note, free from preemptive rights or any other actual
     contingent purchase rights of persons other than the Holder, initially five
     times the number of shares of Common Stock as shall be issuable (taking
     into account the adjustments under this Section 1, but without regard to
     any ownership limitations contained herein) upon the conversion of this
     Note (consisting of the Principal Amount) to Common Stock (the "Required
     Reserve"), provided, however, that the Required Reserve shall be reduced to
     not less than four times the number of shares of Common Stock (as
     calculated above) upon one or more such conversions as shall have caused
     the Required Reserve to be reduced to such "four times" level.  The Company
     covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be issuable will, upon
     issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid, non-assessable and
     freely-tradable (if eligible).  If the amount of shares on reserve in
     Holder's name at the Company's transfer agent for this Note shall drop
     below the Required Reserve, the Company will, within 2 Trading Days of
     notification from Holder, instruct the transfer agent to increase the
     number of shares so that the Required Reserve is met. In the event that
     the Company does not instruct the transfer agent to increase the number of
     shares so that the Required Reserve is met, the Holder will be allowed, if
     applicable, to provide this instruction as per the terms of the Irrevocable
     Transfer Agent Instructions attached to this Note. The Company agrees that
     the maintenance of the Required Reserve is a material term of this Note and
     any breach of this Section 1.00(e) will result in a default of the Note.

(f)  Conversion Limitation.  The Holder will not submit a conversion to the
     Company that would result in the Holder owning more than 4.99% of the then
     total outstanding shares of the Company ("Restricted Ownership Percentage")
     If, on the date of submission of a conversion, the Company's market cap is
     less than $10,000,000, this Restricted Ownership Percentage shall be
     increased to 9.99%.

(g)  Conversion Delays.  If the Company fails to deliver shares in accordance
     with the timeframe stated in Section 1.00(b), the Holder, at any time prior
     to selling all of those shares, may rescind any portion, in whole or in
     part, of that particular conversion attributable to the unsold shares.  The
     rescinded conversion amount will be returned to the Principal Sum with the
     rescinded conversion shares returned to the Company, under the expectation
     that any returned conversion amounts will tack back to the Effective Date.

(h)  Shorting and Hedging.  Holder may not engage in any "shorting" or "hedging"
     transaction(s) in the Common Stock prior to conversion.

(i)  Conversion Right Unconditional.  If the Holder shall provide a Conversion
     Notice as provided herein, the Company's obligations to deliver Common
     Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any claim of
     setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, or alleged breach by the Holder of any
     obligation to the Company.

Section 2.00   Defaults and Remedies.

(a)  Events of Default.  An "Event of Default" is:  (i) a default in payment of
     any amount due hereunder which default continues for more than 5 Trading
     Days after the due date; (ii) a default in the timely issuance of
     underlying shares upon and in accordance with terms of Section 2.00, which
     default continues for 2 Trading Days after the Company has failed to issue
     shares or deliver stock certificates within the 3rd Trading Day following
     the Conversion Date; (iii) failure by the Company for 3 days after notice
     has been received by the Company to comply with any material provision of
     this Note; (iv) failure of the Company to remain compliant with DTC, thus
     incurring a "chilled" status with DTC; (v) if the Company is subject to any
     Bankruptcy Event; (vi) any failure of the Company to satisfy its "filing"
     obligations under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934
     Act") and the rules and guidelines issued by OTC Markets News Service,
     OTCMarkets.com and their affiliates; (vii) any failure of the Company to
     provide the Holder with information related to its corporate structure
     including, but not limited to, the number of authorized and outstanding
     shares, public float, etc. within 1 Trading Day of request by Holder;
     (viii) failure by the Company to maintain the Required Reserve in
     accordance with the terms of Section 1.00(e); (ix) failure of Company's
     Common Stock to maintain a closing bid price in its Principal Market for
     more than 3 consecutive Trading Days; (x) any delisting from a Principal
     Market for any reason; (xi) failure by Company to pay any of its Transfer
     Agent fees in excess of $2,000 or to maintain a Transfer Agent of record;
     (xii) any trading suspension imposed by the Securities and Exchange
     Commission ("SEC") under Sections 12(j) or 12(k) of the 1934 Act; or (xiii)
     failure by the Company to meet all requirements necessary to satisfy the
     availability of Rule 144 to the Holder or its assigns, including but not
     limited to the timely fulfillment of its filing requirements as a
     fully-reporting issuer registered with the SEC, requirements for XBRL
     filings, and requirements for disclosure of financial statements on its
     website.

(b   Remedies.  If an event of default occurs, the outstanding Principal Amount
     of this Note owing in respect thereof through the date of acceleration,
     shall become, at the Holder's election, immediately due and payable in cash
     at the "Mandatory Default Amount".  The Mandatory Default Amount means 150%
     of the outstanding Principal Amount of this Note.  Commencing 5 days after
     the occurrence of any Event of Default that results in the eventual
     acceleration of this Note, this Note shall accrue additional interest, in
     addition to the Note's "guaranteed" interest, at a rate equal to the lesser
     of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law.
     Finally, commencing 5 days after the occurrence of any Event of Default
     that results in the eventual acceleration of this Note, an additional
     permanent 10% increase to the Conversion Price discount will go into
     effect.  In connection with such acceleration described herein, the Holder
     need not provide, and the Issuer hereby waives, any presentment, demand,
     protest or other notice of any kind, and the Holder may immediately and
     without expiration of any grace period enforce any and all of its rights
     and remedies hereunder and all other remedies available to it under
     applicable law.  Such acceleration may be rescinded and annulled by the
     Holder at any time prior to payment hereunder and the Holder shall have
     all rights as a holder of the note until such time, if any, as the Holder
     receives full payment pursuant to this Section 2.00(b).  No such rescission
     or annulment shall affect any subsequent event of default or impair any
     right consequent thereon.  Nothing herein shall limit the Holder's right to
     pursue any other remedies available to it at law or in equity including,
     without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive

                                     -5-
<PAGE>

     relief with respect to the Issuer's failure to timely deliver certificates
     representing shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Note as required
     pursuant to the terms hereof.

Section 3.00   General.

(a)  Payment of Expenses.  The Company agrees to pay all reasonable charges and
     expenses, including attorneys' fees and expenses, which may be incurred by
     the Holder in successfully enforcing this Note and/or collecting any amount
     due under this Note.

(b)  Assignment, Etc.  The Holder may assign or transfer this Note to any
     transferee at its sole discretion.  This Note shall be binding upon the
     Company and its successors and shall inure to the benefit of the Holder and
     its successors and permitted assigns.

(c)  Funding Window.  The Company agrees that it will not enter into a
     convertible debt financing transaction with any party other than the Holder
     for a period of 5 Trading Days following the Effective Date and each
     Additional Consideration Date, as relevant. The Company agrees that this is
     a material term of this Note and any breach of this Section 3.00(c) will
     result in a default of the Note.

(d)  Piggyback Registration Rights.  The Company shall include on the next
     registration statement that the Company files with the SEC (or on the
     subsequent registration statement if such registration statement is
     withdrawn) all shares issuable upon conversion of this Note.  Failure to do
     so will result in liquidated damages of 30% of the outstanding Principal
     Sum of this Note, but not less than $20,000, being immediately due and
     payable to the Holder at its election in the form of a cash payment or an
     addition to the Principal Sum of this Note.

(e)  Terms of Future Financings.  So long as this Note is outstanding, upon any
     issuance by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any convertible debt
     security (whether such debt begins with a convertible feature or such
     feature is added at a later date) with any term more favorable to the
     holder of such security or with a term in favor of the holder of such
     security that was not similarly provided to the Holder in this Note, then
     the Company shall notify the Holder of such additional or more favorable
     term and such term, at the Holder's option, shall become a part of this
     Note and its supporting documentation.. The types of terms contained in the
     other security that may be more favorable to the holder of such security
     include, but are not limited to, terms addressing conversion discounts,
     conversion look back periods, interest rates, original issue discount
     percentages and warrant coverage.

(f)  Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

     (i)   Governing Law.  This Note will be governed by and construed in
           accordance with the laws of the state of California without regard to
           any conflicts of laws or provisions thereof that would otherwise
           require the application of the law of any other jurisdiction.

     (ii)  Jurisdiction and Venue.  Any dispute or claim arising to or in any
           way related to this Note or the rights and obligations of each of the
           parties shall be brought only in the state courts of California or in
           the federal courts located in San Diego County, California.



                                     -6-
<PAGE>

     (iii) No Jury Trial.  The Company hereto knowingly and voluntarily waives
           any and all rights it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any
           litigation based on, or arising out of, under, or in connection with,
           this Note.

     (iv)  Delivery of Process by the Holder to the Company.  In the event of an

           action or proceeding by the Holder against the Company, and only by
           the Holder against the Company, service of copies of summons and/or
           complaint and/or any other process that may be served in any such
           action or proceeding may be made by the Holder via U.S. Mail,
           overnight delivery service such as FedEx or UPS, email, fax, or
           process server, or by mailing or otherwise delivering a copy of such
           process to the Company at its last known attorney as set forth in its
           most recent SEC filing.

     (v)   Notices.  Any notice required or permitted hereunder (including
           Conversion Notices) must be in writing and either personally served,
           sent by facsimile or email transmission, or sent by overnight
           courier.  Notices will be deemed effectively delivered at the time of
           transmission if by facsimile or email, and if by overnight courier
           the business day after such notice is deposited with the courier
           service for delivery.

(g)  No Bad Actor.  No officer or director of the Company would be disqualified
     under Rule 506(d) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on the basis
     of being a "bad actor" as that term is established in the September 13,
     2013 Small Entity Compliance Guide published by the SEC.

(h)  Usury.  If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed
     interest due hereunder violates any applicable law governing usury, the
     applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically be lowered to
     equal the maximum rate of interest permitted under applicable law.  The
     Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will
     not seek to claim or take advantage of any law that would prohibit or
     forgive the Company from paying all or a portion of the principal, fees,
     liquidated damages or interest on this Note.

                     IRREVOCABLE TRANSFER AGENT INSTRUCTIONS


DATE:    July 9, 2015

Signature Stock Transfer, Inc
2632 Coachlight Court
Plano, TX 75075

Ladies and Gentlemen:

On behalf of Empire Global Corp, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
reference is made to that certain Convertible Promissory Note with an original
principal value of $220,000 (the "Note") along with exhibits A, B, C and D of
the Note, all dated July 9, 2015 (and together are referred to as the
"Agreement"), by and between the Company and Tangiers Investment Group, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the "Holder"). A copy of the above are
attached hereto. Pursuant to the terms of the Note the Holder is given the right
to convert, from time to time, all or any portion of the Note into shares of
common stock (the "Shares") of the Company (the "Common Stock" or "Subject
Shares"). We ask that you familiarize yourself with your issuance and delivery
obligations as Transfer Agent, contained herein.

From and after the date hereof and until all of Company's obligations under the
Note are paid and performed in full:

(a) you are hereby authorized to establish a reserve of shares of authorized but
    unissued Common Stock of the Company in an amount not less than 1,000,000
    shares (the "Transfer Agent Reserve") for issuance upon partial or full
    conversion of the Note listed above in accordance with the terms thereof,

(b) you shall maintain and hold the Transfer Agent Reserve for the exclusive
    benefit of Holder,

(c) you shall issue the shares of Common Stock held in the Transfer Agent
    Reserve to Holder or its broker only (subject to the immediately following
    clause (d))

(d) when you issue shares of Common Stock to Holder or its broker under the Note
    pursuant to the other instructions in this Letter, you shall first issue
    such shares from the Company's authorized and unissued shares of Common
    Stock to the extent the same are available and not from the Transfer Agent
    Reserve unless and until there are no authorized shares of Common Stock
    available for issuance other than those held in the Transfer Agent Reserve,
    at which point, and upon your receipt of authorization solely from Holder,
    you shall then issue any shares of Common Stock deliverable to Holder under
    the Note from the Transfer Agent Reserve

(e) you shall not otherwise reduce the Transfer Agent Reserve under any
    circumstances, unless Holder delivers to you written pre-approval of such
    reduction, and

(f) you shall immediately add shares of Common Stock to the Transfer Agent

                                    -1-
<PAGE>

    Reserve as and when requested by Company or Holder in writing from time to
    time, according to the terms provided in Section 1.00(e) of the Note.

The ability to convert the Note in a timely manner is a material obligation of
the Company pursuant to the Note.  Your firm is hereby irrevocably authorized
and instructed to issue shares of Common Stock of the Company (without any
restrictive legend) to the Holder without any further action or confirmation by
the Company upon your receipt from the Holder of (a) a notice of conversion
("Conversion Notice") executed by the Holder; and (b) an opinion of counsel of
the Holder, in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in
comparable transactions (and satisfactory to the transfer agent), to the effect
that the shares of Common Stock of the Company issued to the Holder pursuant to
the Conversion Notice are not "restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 and
should be issued to the Holder without any restrictive legend. Please note that
a share issuance resolution is not required for each conversion since these
instructions and the Note have previously been approved by a resolution of the
Company's board of directors.

The Company hereby requests that your firm act immediately, without delay and
without the need for any action or confirmation by the Company with respect to
the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to any Conversion Notices received from
the Holder. Your firm will not delay in processing any Conversion Notices owing
to the fact that the Company is in arrears of its fees and other monies owed to
your firm, provided that the Holder agrees that each time a Conversion Notice
is delivered to your firm, in the event the Company refuses to pay the cost
associated with processing a Conversion Notice (in contradiction with the terms
of the Note) the Holder agrees to pay the cost of processing the Conversion
Notice a sum not to exceed $250.00 for each such transaction.

The Holder shall reserve the right to maintain this Transfer Agent Reserve
beyond the date of retirement of the Note provided that there are other existing
securities issued by the Company in the Holder's name as of the date of that
retirement and said securities require a share reserve to be maintained. The
Holder shall be allowed to re-assign this Transfer Agent Reserve to any other
existing securities issued by the Company in Holder's name. This Transfer Agent
Reserve may not be transferred, extinguished or otherwise re-assigned without
prior written approval by the Holder.

The Company hereby directs you, upon request by the Holder or Holder's broker
dealer, to immediately provide any capitalization structure information
pertaining to the number of common shares of the Company that are issued and
outstanding, authorized, reserved, or in the public float.

The Company shall indemnify you and your officers, directors, principals,
partners, agents and representatives, and hold each of them harmless from and
against any and all loss, liability, damage, claim or  expense (including the
reasonable fees and disbursements of its attorneys) incurred by or asserted
against you or any of them arising out of or in connection with the instructions
set forth herein, the performance of your duties hereunder and otherwise in
respect hereof, including the costs and expenses of defending yourself or
themselves against any claim or liability hereunder, except that the Company
shall not be liable hereunder as to matters in respect of which it is determined
that you have acted with gross negligence or in bad faith (which gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct must be determined by a final,
non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent
jurisdiction). You shall have no liability to the Company in respect to any
action taken or any failure to act in respect of this if such action was taken
or omitted to be taken in good faith, and you shall be entitled to rely in this
regard on the advice of counsel.

                                    -2-

The Company agrees, in the event of a change in transfer agents, that the
Transfer Agent Reserve shall be automatically reestablished at the new transfer
agent.

The Holder is intended to be and is a third party beneficiary hereof, and no
amendment or modification to the instructions set forth herein may be made
without the consent of the Holder. As such, the Company hereby directs you to
disregard any contrary instruction provided by or on behalf of the Company or
any other person purporting to represent the Company unless accompanied by

2.4   CONDITIONS TO INVESTOR'S OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE SHARES. Notwithstanding
      anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not be
      entitled to deliver a Put Notice and the Investor shall not be obligated
      to purchase any Shares at a Closing unless each of the following
      conditions are satisfied:

                                     -4-
<PAGE>

      i.  a Registration Statement shall have been declared effective and shall
           remain effective and available for the resale of all the Put Shares
           Due at all times until the Closing with respect to the applicable Put
           Notice;

      ii.  at all times during the period beginning on the related Put Notice
           Date and ending on and including the related Closing Date, the Common
           Stock shall have been listed or quoted for trading on the Principal
           Market and shall not have been suspended from trading thereon during
           the Pricing Period and the Company shall not have been notified of
           any pending or threatened proceeding or other action to suspend the
           trading of the Common Stock;

     iii.  the Company has complied with its obligations and is otherwise not in
           material breach of or in material default under, this Agreement, the
           Registration Rights Agreement or any other agreement executed in
           connection herewith which has not been cured prior to delivery to the
           Investor of the applicable Put Notice;

      iv.  no injunction shall have been issued and remain in force, or action
           commenced by a governmental authority which has not been stayed or
           abandoned, prohibiting the purchase or the issuance of the
           Securities; and

       v.  the issuance of the Securities will not violate any shareholder
           approval requirements of the Principal Market.

      If any of the events described in clauses (i) through (v) above occurs
      during a Pricing Period, then the Investor shall have no obligation to
      purchase the Put Amount of Common Stock set forth in the applicable Put
      Notice.

2.5   MECHANICS OF PURCHASE OF SHARES BY INVESTOR. Subject to the satisfaction
      of the conditions set forth in Sections 2.6, 7 and 8 of this Agreement,
      the closing of the purchase by the Investor of Securities (a "Closing")
      shall occur on the date which is no earlier than five (5) Trading Days
      prior to and no later than seven (7) Trading Days following the applicable
      Put Notice Date (each a "Closing Date"). On each such Closing Date, if the
      Company's transfer agent is participating in The Depository Trust Company
      ("DTC") Fast Automated Securities Transfer ("FAST") program and that the
      Securities are eligible for inclusion in the FAST program, the Company
      shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause its transfer agent
      to electronically transmit the Securities to be issued to the Investor on
      such date by crediting the account of the Investor's prime broker (as
      specified by the Investor in a Put Settlement Sheet) with DTC through its
      DWAC service. If the Company is not DWAC eligible or the Company is under
      DTC "chill" on such Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the
      Investor pursuant to this Agreement, certificates representing the
      Securities to be issued to the Investor on such date and registered in the
      name of the Investor (the "Certificate"). On such Closing Date, after
      receipt of confirmation of delivery of such Securities to the Investor,
      the Investor shall disburse the funds constituting the Purchase Amount to
      the Company's designated account by wire transfer of (i) immediately
      available funds if the Investor receives the Securities by 9:30 a.m.
      (Pacific time) or (ii) next day available funds if the Investor receives
      the Securities thereafter.

2.6   OVERALL LIMIT ON COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE. Notwithstanding anything contained
      herein to the contrary, if during the Open Period the Company becomes
      listed on an exchange that limits the number of shares of Common Stock
                                     -5-
<PAGE>

      that may be issued without shareholder approval, then the number of Shares
      issuable by the Company and purchasable by the Investor, shall not exceed
      that number of the shares of Common Stock that may be issuable without
      shareholder approval (the "Maximum Common Stock Issuance"). If such
      issuance of shares of Common Stock could cause a delisting on the
      Principal Market, then the Maximum Common Stock Issuance shall first be
      approved by the Company's shareholders in accordance with applicable law
      and the By-laws and the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, if such
      issuance of shares of Common Stock could cause a delisting on the
      Principal Market. The parties understand and agree that the Company's
      failure to seek or obtain such shareholder approval shall in no way
      adversely affect the validity and due authorization of the issuance and
      sale of Securities or the Investor's obligation in accordance with the
      terms and conditions hereof to purchase a number of Shares in the
      aggregate up to the Maximum Common Stock Issuance limitation, and that
      such approval pertains only to the applicability of the Maximum Common
      Stock Issuance limitation provided in this Section 2.6.

2.7   LIMITATION ON AMOUNT OF OWNERSHIP. Notwithstanding anything to the
      contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the Investor be entitled to
      purchase that number of Shares, which when added to the sum of the number
      of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned (as such term is defined
      under Section 13(d) and Rule 13d-3 of the 1934 Act), by the Investor,
      would exceed 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on
      the Closing Date, as determined in accordance with Rule 13d-1(j) of the
      1934 Act.


                                    SECTION III
              INVESTOR'S REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

The Investor represents and warrants to the Company, and covenants, that:

3.1   SOPHISTICATED INVESTOR. The Investor has, by reason of its business and
      financial experience, such knowledge, sophistication and experience in
      financial and business matters and in making investment decisions of this
      type that it is capable of (i) evaluating the merits and risks of an
      investment in the Securities and making an informed investment decision;
      (ii) protecting its own interest; and (iii) bearing the economic risk of
      such investment for an indefinite period of time.

3.2   AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEMENT. This Agreement has been duly and validly
      authorized, executed and delivered on behalf of the Investor and is a
      valid and binding agreement of the Investor enforceable against the
      Investor in accordance with its terms, subject as to enforceability to
      general principles of equity and to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
      reorganization, moratorium, liquidation and other similar laws relating
      to, or affecting generally, the enforcement of applicable creditors'
      rights and remedies.

3.3   SECTION 9 OF THE 1934 ACT. During the term of this Agreement, the
      Investor will comply with the provisions of Section 9 of the 1934 Act,
      and the rules promulgated thereunder, with respect to transactions
      involving the Common Stock. The Investor agrees not to short sell the
      Company's stock either directly or indirectly through its affiliates,
      principals or advisors, the Common Stock during the term of this
      Agreement. The Investor will only sell Company stock that it has in its
      possession.


                                     -6-
<PAGE>

      term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D of the 1933 Act.

3.5   NO CONFLICTS. The execution, delivery and performance of the
      Registered Offering Transaction Documents by the Investor and the
      consummation by the Investor of the transactions contemplated hereby and
      thereby will not result in a violation of limited liability company
      agreement or other organizational documents of the Investor.

3.6   OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS. The Investor has received all materials
      relating to the Company's business, finance and operations which it has
      requested. The Investor has had an opportunity to discuss the business,
      management and financial affairs of the Company with the Company's
      management.

3.7   INVESTMENT PURPOSES. The Investor is purchasing the Securities for
      its own account for investment purposes and not with a view towards
      distribution and agrees to resell or otherwise dispose of the Securities
      solely in accordance with the registration provisions of the 1933 Act (or
      pursuant to an exemption from such registration provisions).

3.8   NO REGISTRATION AS A DEALER. The Investor is not and will not be
      required to be registered as a "dealer" under the 1934 Act, either as a
      result of its execution and performance of its obligations under this
      Agreement or otherwise.

      organized, validly existing and in good standing in the State of
      Delaware.

      own tax liabilities.

      regarding the Securities published in any newspaper, magazine or similar
      media or broadcast over television or radio or presented at any seminar
      or any other general solicitation or general advertisement.

3.13  TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. The Securities may only be disposed of in
      compliance with federal and state securities laws. In connection with any
      transfer of Securities other than pursuant to an effective registration
      statement or Rule 144, to the Company or to an affiliate of the Investor,
      the Company may require the transferor thereof to provide to the Company
      an opinion of counsel selected by the transferor and reasonably
      acceptable to the Company, the form and substance of which opinion shall
      be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such
      transfer does not require registration of such transferred Securities
      under the 1933 Act; provided, however, that in connection with any
      transfer of Securities pursuant to Rule 144, the Company may require the
      transferor to provide a customary Rule 144 sellers representation letter.
      As a condition of transfer, any such transferee shall agree in writing to
      be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall have the rights of the
      Investor under this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, as
      to issued Securities only.

                                  SECTION IV
                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

      Except as set forth in the Schedules attached hereto, or as disclosed on
      the Company's SEC Documents, the Company represents and warrants to the
      Investor that:

4.1   ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION. The Company is a corporation duly
      organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the
      State of Delaware, and has the requisite corporate power and
      authorization to own its properties and to carry on its business as now
      being conducted. Both the Company and the companies it owns or controls
      ("Subsidiaries") are duly qualified to do business and are in good
      standing in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or the
      nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification
      necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be
      in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. As used in
      this Agreement, "Material Adverse Effect" means a change, event,
      circumstance, effect or state of facts that has had or is reasonably
      likely to have, a material adverse effect on the business, properties,
      assets, operations, results of operations, financial condition or
      prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, if any, taken as a whole,

      termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any material
      agreement, contract, indenture mortgage, indebtedness or instrument to

      order, judgment or decree (including United States federal and state
      securities laws and regulations and the rules and regulations of the
      Principal Market or principal securities exchange or trading market on
      which the Common Stock is traded or listed) applicable to the Company or

      indebtedness, indenture, instrument, judgment, decree or order or any
      statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or its
      Subsidiaries, except for possible conflicts, defaults, terminations,
      amendments, accelerations, cancellations and violations that would not
      individually or in the aggregate have or constitute a Material Adverse
      Effect. The business of the Company and its Subsidiaries is not being
      conducted, and shall not be conducted, in violation of any law, statute,
      ordinance, rule, order or regulation of any governmental authority or
      agency, regulatory or self-regulatory agency, or court, except for
      possible violations the sanctions for which either individually or in the
      aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as
      specifically contemplated by this Agreement and as required under the
      1933 Act or any securities laws of any states, to the Company's
      knowledge, the Company is not required to obtain any consent,
      authorization, permit or order of, or make any filing or registration
      (except the filing of a registration statement as outlined in the
      Registration Rights Agreement between the parties) with, any court,
      governmental authority or agency, regulatory or self-regulatory agency or
      other third party in order for it to execute, deliver or perform any of
      its obligations under, or contemplated by, the Registered Offering
      Transaction Documents in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof. All
      consents, authorizations, permits, orders, filings and registrations
      which the Company is required to obtain pursuant to the preceding
      sentence have been obtained or effected on or prior to the date hereof
      and are in full force and effect as of the date hereof. The Company and
      its Subsidiaries are unaware of any facts or circumstances which might
      give rise to any of the foregoing. The Company is not, and will not be,
      in violation of the listing requirements of the Principal Market as in
      effect on the date hereof and on each of the Closing Dates and is not
      aware of any facts which would reasonably lead to delisting of the Common
      Stock by the Principal Market in the foreseeable future.

4.6   SEC DOCUMENTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. As of the date hereof, the
      Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
      documents required to be filed by it with the SEC pursuant to the
      reporting requirements of the 1934 Act (all of the foregoing filed prior
      to the date hereof and all exhibits included therein and financial
                                     -10-

      statements and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference
      therein, and amendments thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the
      "SEC Documents"). The Company has delivered to the Investor or its
      representatives, or they have had access through EDGAR to, true and
      complete copies of the SEC Documents. As of their respective filing
      dates, the SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
      requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
      promulgated thereunder applicable to the SEC Documents, and none of the
      SEC Documents, at the time they were filed with the SEC or the time they
      were amended, if amended, contained any untrue statement of a material
      fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
      necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
      under which they were made, not misleading. As of their respective dates,
      the financial statements of the Company included in the SEC Documents
      complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
      requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
      respect thereto. Such financial statements have been prepared in
      accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, by a firm that
      is a member of the Public Companies Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB")
      consistently applied, during the periods involved (except (i) as may be
      otherwise indicated in such financial statements or the notes thereto, or
      (ii) in the case of unaudited interim statements, to the extent they may
      exclude footnotes or may be condensed or summary statements) and fairly
      present in all material respects the financial position of the Company as
      of the dates thereof and the results of its operations and cash flows for
      the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
      normal year-end audit adjustments). No other written information provided
      by or on behalf of the Company to the Investor which is not included in
      the SEC Documents, including, without limitation, information referred to
      in Section 4.3 of this Agreement, contains any untrue statement of a
      material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the
      statements therein, in the light of the circumstance under which they are
      or were made, not misleading. The Company's knowledge, neither the
      Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any of their officers, directors,
      employees or agents have provided the Investor with any material,
      nonpublic information which was not publicly disclosed prior to the date
      hereof and any material, nonpublic information provided to the Investor
      by the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their officers, directors,
      employees or agents prior to any Closing Date shall be publicly disclosed
      by the Company prior to such Closing Date.

4.7   ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Except as otherwise set forth in the SEC
      Documents, the Company does not intend to change the business operations
      of the Company in any material way. The Company has not taken any steps,
      and does not currently expect to take any steps, to seek protection
      pursuant to any bankruptcy law nor does the Company or its Subsidiaries
      have any knowledge or reason to believe that its creditors intend to
      initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.

4.8   ABSENCE OF LITIGATION AND/OR REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS. Except as set
      forth in the SEC Documents, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry
      or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency,
      self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the
      executive officers of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened
      against or affecting the Company, the Common Stock or any of the
      Company's Subsidiaries or any of the Company's or the Company's
      Subsidiaries' officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which
      an adverse decision could have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.9   ACKNOWLEDGMENT REGARDING INVESTOR'S PURCHASE OF SHARES. The Company
      acknowledges and agrees that the Investor is acting solely in the
      capacity of an arm's length purchaser with respect to the Registered
      Offering Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby
      and thereby. The Company further acknowledges that the Investor is not
      acting as a financial advisor or fiduciary of the Company (or in any
      similar capacity) with respect to the Registered Offering Transaction
      Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and any
      advice given by the Investor or any of its respective representatives or
      agents in connection with the Registered Offering Transaction Documents
      and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby is merely incidental
      to the Investor's purchase of the Securities, and is not being relied on
      by the Company. The Company further represents to the Investor that the
      Company's decision to enter into the Registered Offering Transaction
      Documents has been based solely on the independent evaluation by the
      Company and its representatives.

4.10  NO UNDISCLOSED EVENTS, LIABILITIES, DEVELOPMENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES.
      Except as set forth in the SEC Documents or required with respect to the
      Registered Offering Transaction Documents, as of the date hereof, no
      event, liability, development or circumstance has occurred or exists, or
      to the Company's knowledge is contemplated to occur, with respect to the
      Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective business, properties,
      assets, prospects, operations or financial condition, that would be
      required to be disclosed by the Company under applicable securities laws
      on a registration statement filed with the SEC relating to an issuance
      and sale by the Company of its Common Stock and which has not been
      publicly announced.

4.11  EMPLOYEE RELATIONS. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
      is involved in any union labor dispute nor, to the knowledge of the
      Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is any such dispute threatened.
      Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to a
      collective bargaining agreement, and the Company and its Subsidiaries
      believe that relations with their employees are good. No executive
      officer (as defined in Rule 501(f) of the 1933 Act) has notified the
      Company that such officer intends to leave the Company's employ or
      otherwise terminate such officer's employment with the Company.

4.12  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. The Company and its Subsidiaries own
      or possess adequate rights or licenses to use all trademarks, trade
      names, service marks, service mark registrations, service names, patents,
      patent rights, copyrights, inventions, licenses, approvals, governmental
      authorizations, trade secrets and rights necessary to conduct their
      respective businesses as now conducted. Except as set forth in the SEC
      Documents, none of the Company's trademarks, trade names, service marks,
      service mark registrations, service names, patents, patent rights,
      copyrights, inventions, licenses, approvals, government authorizations,
      trade secrets or other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct
      its business as now or as proposed to be conducted have expired or
      terminated, or are expected to expire or terminate within two (2) years
      from the date of this Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not
      have any knowledge of any infringement by the Company or its Subsidiaries
      of trademark, trade name rights, patents, patent rights, copyrights,
      inventions, licenses, service names, service marks, service mark
      registrations, trade secret or other similar rights of others, or of any
      such development of similar or identical trade secrets or technical
      information by others and, except as set forth in the SEC Documents,
      there is no claim, action or proceeding being made or brought against, or
      to the Company's knowledge, being threatened against, the Company or its
                                     -12-
<PAGE>

      Subsidiaries regarding trademark, trade name, patents, patent rights,
      invention, copyright, license, service names, service marks, service mark
      registrations, trade secret or other infringement; and the Company and
      its Subsidiaries are unaware of any facts or circumstances which might
      give rise to any of the foregoing. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
      taken commercially reasonable security measures to protect the secrecy,
      confidentiality and value of all of their intellectual properties.

4.13  ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. The Company and its Subsidiaries (i) are, to the
      knowledge of the management and directors of the Company and its
      Subsidiaries, in compliance with any and all applicable foreign, federal,
      state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human
      health and safety, the environment or hazardous or toxic substances or
      wastes, pollutants or contaminants ("Environmental Laws"); (ii) have, to
      the knowledge of the management and directors of the Company, received
      all permits, licenses or other approvals required of them under
      applicable Environmental Laws to conduct their respective businesses as
      currently conducted; and (iii) are in compliance, to the knowledge of the
      management and directors of the Company, with all terms and conditions of
      any such permit, license or approval where, in each of the three (3)
      foregoing cases, the failure to so comply would have, individually or in
      the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

4.14  TITLE. The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable
      title to all personal property owned by them which is material to the
      business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case free and clear
      of all liens, encumbrances and defects except such as are described in
      the SEC Documents or such as do not materially affect the value of such
      property and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made
      of such property by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any real
      property and facilities held under lease by the Company or any of its
      Subsidiaries are held by them under valid, subsisting and enforceable
      leases with such exceptions as are not material and do not interfere with
      the use made and proposed to be made of such property and buildings by
      the Company and its Subsidiaries.

4.15  INSURANCE. Each of the Company's Subsidiaries are insured by
      insurers of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and
      risks and in such amounts as management of the Company reasonably
      believes to be prudent and customary in the businesses in which the
      Company and its Subsidiaries are engaged. Neither the Company nor any of
      its Subsidiaries has been refused any insurance coverage sought or
      applied for and neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has any reason
      to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance
      coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage
      from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a
      cost that would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.16  REGULATORY PERMITS. The Company and its Subsidiaries have in full
      force and effect all certificates, approvals, authorizations and permits
      from the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign regulatory
      authorities and comparable foreign regulatory agencies, necessary to own,
      lease or operate their respective properties and assets and conduct their
      respective businesses in the manner currently being conducted, and
      neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary has received any notice of
      proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such
      certificate, approval, authorization or permit, except for such
      certificates, approvals, authorizations or permits which if not obtained,
      or such revocations or modifications which, would not have a Material
      Adverse Effect.
                                     -13-

4.17  INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS. Except as otherwise set forth in the
      SEC Documents, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries maintain a system
      of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
      assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with
      management's general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are
      recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
      conformity with generally accepted accounting principles by a firm with

      membership to the PCAOB and to maintain asset accountability; (iii)
      access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
      general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability
      for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals
      and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. The
      Company's management has determined that the Company's internal
      accounting controls were not effective as of the date of this Agreement
      as further described in the SEC Documents.

4.18  NO MATERIALLY ADVERSE CONTRACTS, ETC. Neither the Company nor any of
      its Subsidiaries is subject to any charter, corporate or other legal
      restriction, or any judgment, decree, order, rule or regulation which in
      the judgment of the Company's officers has or is expected in the future
      to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
      Subsidiaries is a party to any contract or agreement which in the
      judgment of the Company's officers has or is expected to have a Material
      Adverse Effect.

4.19  TAX STATUS. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has made or
      filed all United States federal and state income and all other tax
      returns, reports and declarations required by any jurisdiction to which
      it is subject (unless and only to the extent that the Company and each of
      its Subsidiaries has set aside on its books provisions reasonably
      adequate for the payment of all unpaid and unreported taxes) and has paid
      all taxes and other governmental assessments and charges that are
      material in amount, shown or determined to be due on such returns,
      reports and declarations, except those being contested in good faith and
      has set aside on its books provision reasonably adequate for the payment
      of all taxes for periods subsequent to the periods to which such returns,
      reports or declarations apply. There are no unpaid taxes in any material
      amount claimed to be due by the taxing authority of any jurisdiction, and
      the officers of the Company know of no basis for any such claim.

4.20  CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. Except as set forth in the SEC Documents and
      except for transactions pursuant to which the Company makes payments in
      the ordinary course of business upon terms no less favorable than the
      Company could obtain from disinterested third parties and other than the
      grant of stock options disclosed in the SEC Documents, none of the
      officers, directors, or employees of the Company is presently a party to
      any transaction with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
      for services as employees, consultants, officers and directors),
      including any contract, agreement or other arrangement providing for the
      furnishing of services to or by, providing for rental of real or personal
      property to or from, or otherwise requiring payments to or from any
      officer, director or such employee or, to the knowledge of the Company,
      any corporation, partnership, trust or other entity in which any officer,
      director, or any such employee has a substantial interest or is an
      officer, director, trustee or partner, such that disclosure would be
      required in the SEC Documents.

4.21  DILUTIVE EFFECT. The Company understands and acknowledges that the
      number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon purchases pursuant to this
                                     -14-
<PAGE>

      Agreement will increase in certain circumstances including, but not
      necessarily limited to, the circumstance wherein the trading price of the
      Common Stock declines during the period between the Effective Date and
      the end of the Open Period. The Company's executive officers and
      directors have studied and fully understand the nature of the
      transactions contemplated by this Agreement and recognize that they have
      a potential dilutive effect on the shareholders of the Company. The board
      of directors of the Company has concluded, in its good faith business
      judgment, and with full understanding of the implications, that such
      issuance is in the best interests of the Company. The Company
      specifically acknowledges that, subject to such limitations as are
      expressly set forth in the Registered Offering Transaction Documents, its
      obligation to issue shares of Common Stock upon purchases pursuant to
      this Agreement is absolute and unconditional regardless of the dilutive
      effect that such issuance may have on the ownership interests of other
      shareholders of the Company.

4.22  LOCK-UP. The Company shall cause its officers, insiders, directors,
      and affiliates or other related parties under control of the Company, to
      refrain from selling Common Stock during each Pricing Period.

4.23  NO GENERAL SOLICITATION. Neither the Company, nor any of its
      affiliates, nor any person acting on its behalf, has engaged in any form

      Party, or (iii) any agreement, transaction, commitment or arrangement
      which is approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the
                                     -16-

      address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that
      such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and
      notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any

      benefit of the parties hereto and is not for the benefit of, nor may any
      provision hereof be enforced by, any other person.

11.10 SURVIVAL. The representations and warranties of the Company and the
      Investor contained in Sections 3 and 4, the agreements and covenants set
      forth in Section 5, the indemnification provisions set forth in Section
      10 and this Section 11, shall survive each of the Closings and the
      termination of this Agreement.

11.11 PUBLICITY. The Company and the Investor shall consult with each
      other in issuing any press releases or otherwise making public statements
      with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and no party shall
      issue any such press release or otherwise make any such public statement
      without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
      unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that no prior consent shall be
      required if such disclosure is required by law, as determined solely by
      the Company in consultation with its counsel. The Investor acknowledges
      that this Agreement and all or part of the Registered Offering
      Transaction Documents may be deemed to be "material contracts" as that
      term is defined by Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K, and that the
      Company may therefore be required to file such documents as exhibits to
      reports or registration statements filed under the 1933 Act or the 1934
      Act. The Investor further agrees that the status of such documents and
      materials as material contracts shall be determined solely by the

      Date and (ii) termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.

11.13 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be
      done and performed, all such further acts and things, and shall execute
      and deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and
      documents, as the other party may reasonably request in order to carry
      out the intent and accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the
      consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

11.14 NO STRICT CONSTRUCTION. The language used in this Agreement will be
      deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual
      intent, and no rules of strict construction will be applied against any
      party, as the parties mutually agree that each has had a full and fair
      opportunity to review this Agreement and seek the advice of counsel on
      it.

11.15 REMEDIES. The Investor shall have all rights and remedies set forth
      in this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement and all rights
      and remedies which such holders have been granted at any time under any
      other agreement or contract and all of the rights which the Investor has
      by law. Any person having any rights under any provision of this
      Agreement shall be entitled to enforce such rights specifically (without
      posting a bond or other security), to recover damages by reason of any
      default or breach of any provision of this Agreement, including the
      recovery of reasonable attorneys fees and costs, and to exercise all
      other rights granted by law.


                                     -23-

11.16 PAYMENT SET ASIDE. To the extent that the Company makes a payment
      or payments to the Investor hereunder or under the Registration Rights
      Agreement or the Investor enforces or exercises its rights hereunder or
      thereunder, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such
      enforcement or exercise or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
      declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from,
      disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored
      to the Company, a trustee, receiver or any other person under any law
      (including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, state or federal law,
      common law or equitable cause of action), then to the extent of any such
      restoration the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be
      satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if
      such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not
      occurred.

11.17 COMMITMENT FEE. Upon the date of execution of this Agreement, the
      Company shall be required to issue to the Purchaser one percent (1%) of
      the total Commitment Amount in the form of a twelve (12) month zero
      percent (0%) interest convertible debenture as a commitment fee (the
      "Commitment Fee Debenture"). The Commitment Fee Debenture shall be
      convertible into shares of the Company's Common stock at the lower of
      $.50 or eighty five percent (85%) of the closing bid price of the
      Company's common stock on the date on which Holder elects to convert all
      or part of the Note. If the Company is placed on "chilled" status with
      DTC, the discount shall be increased by ten percent (10%) until such
      chill is remedied. If the Company is not DWAC eligible through their
      Transfer Agent and DTC FAST system, the discount will be increased by
      five percent (5%). In the case of both, the discount shall be a
      cumulative fifteen percent (15%).


                                   SECTION XII
                    NON-DISCLOSURE OF NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION

The Company shall not disclose non-public information to the Investor, its
advisors, or its representatives. Nothing in the Registered Offering Transaction
Documents shall require or be deemed to require the Company to disclose
non-public information to the Investor or its advisors or representatives, and
the Company represents that it does not disseminate non-public information to
any investors who purchase stock in the Company in a public offering, to money
managers or to securities analysts, provided, however, that notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Company will, as hereinabove provided,
immediately notify the advisors and representatives of the Investor and, if any,
underwriters, of any event or the existence of any circumstance (without any
obligation to disclose the specific event or circumstance) of which it becomes
aware, constituting non-public information (whether or not requested of the
Company specifically or generally during the course of due diligence by such
persons or entities), which, if not disclosed in the prospectus included in the
Registration Statement would cause such prospectus to include a material
misstatement or to omit a material fact required to be stated therein in order
to make the statements, therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading. Nothing contained in this Section 12 shall be
construed to mean that such persons or entities other than the Investor (without
the written consent of the Investor prior to disclosure of such information) may
not obtain non-public information in the course of conducting due diligence in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and nothing herein shall prevent any
such persons or entities from notifying the Company of their opinion that based
on such due diligence by such persons or entities, that the Registration


                                     -24-
<PAGE>

Statement contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits a material fact
required to be stated in the Registration Statement or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading.


                                  SECTION XIII
                        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OF THE PARTIES

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto
hereby acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) the Investor makes no
representations or covenants that it will not engage in trading in the
securities of the Company, other than the Investor will not short or pre-sell,
either directly or indirectly through its affiliates, principals or advisors,
the Common Stock at any time during the Open Period; (ii) the Company shall
comply with its obligations under Section 5.8 in a timely manner; (iii) the
Company has not and shall not provide material non-public information to the
Investor unless prior thereto the Investor shall have executed a written
agreement regarding the confidentiality and use of such information; and (iv)
the Company understands and confirms that the Investor will be relying on the
acknowledgements set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) above if the Investor
effects any transactions in the securities of the Company.

2.1  The Company shall use its best efforts to, within thirty (30) days of the

2.3  Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in Section 2.1, if
     the staff of the SEC (the "Staff") or the SEC informs the Company that all
     of the unregistered Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the
     application of Rule 415, be registered for resale as a secondary offering

     inform the Investor and use its commercially reasonable efforts to file

     Registration Statement, as the case may be, under clauses (i) or (ii)
     above, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file
     with the SEC, as promptly as allowed by the Staff or SEC, one or more
     registration statements on Form S-1 to register for resale those
     Registrable Securities that were not registered for resale on the
     Registration Statement, as amended, or the New Registration Statement.
     Additionally, the Company shall have the ability to file one or more New
     Registration Statements to cover the Registrable Securities once the Shares

                                   SECTION III
                               RELATED OBLIGATIONS

At such time as the Company is obligated to prepare and file the Registration
Statement with the SEC pursuant to Section 2, the Company shall effect the
registration of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
method of disposition thereof and, with respect thereto, the Company shall have
the following obligations:

3.1  Upon the effectiveness of such Registration Statement relating to the
     Registrable Securities, the Company shall keep such Registration Statement
     effective until the earlier to occur of the date on which (A) the Investor
     shall have sold all the Registrable Securities actually issued or that the
     Company has an obligation to issue under the Investment Agreement; or (B)
     the Investor has no right to acquire any additional shares of Common Stock
     under the Investment Agreement; or (C) the Investor may sell the
     Registrable Securities without volume limitations under Rule 144 (the
     "Registration Period"). The Registration Statement (including any
     amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses contained therein) shall
     not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
     material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the
     statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made,
     not misleading. The Investor agrees to provide all information which it is
     required by law to provide to the Company, including the intended method of
     disposition of the Registrable Securities, and the Company's obligations
     set forth in this Agreement shall be conditioned on the receipt of such
     information.

                                     -3-
<PAGE>

3.2  The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments (including
     post-effective amendments) and supplements to the Registration Statement
     and the prospectus used in connection with such Registration Statement,
     which prospectus is to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 promulgated under the
     1933 Act, as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective
     during the Registration Period, and, during such period, comply with the
     provisions of the 1933 Act with respect to the disposition of all
     Registrable Securities of the Company covered by such Registration
     Statement until such time as all of such Registrable Securities shall have
     been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by
     the Investor thereof as set forth in such Registration Statement. In the
     event the number of shares of Common Stock covered by the Registration
     Statement filed pursuant to this Agreement is at any time insufficient to
     cover all of the Registrable Securities, the Company shall amend such
     Registration Statement, or file a new Registration Statement (on the short
     form available therefor, if applicable), or both, so as to cover all of the
     Registrable Securities, in each case, as soon as practicable, but in any
     event within thirty (30) calendar days after the necessity therefor arises
     (based on the then Purchase Price of the Common Stock and other relevant
     factors on which the Company reasonably elects to rely), assuming the
     Company has sufficient authorized shares at that time, and if it does not,
     within thirty (30) calendar days after such shares are authorized. The
     Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such amendment
     and/or new Registration Statement to become effective as soon as
     practicable following the filing thereof.

3.3  As promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event, the Company
     shall notify Investor in writing of the happening of any event as a result
     of which the prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as then in
     effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to
     state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
     the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
     made, not misleading ("Registration Default") and use all diligent efforts
     to promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such Registration
     Statement and take any other necessary steps to cure the Registration
     Default (which, if such Registration Statement is on Form S-3, may consist
     of a document to be filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to Section
     13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act and to be incorporated by
     reference in the prospectus) to correct such untrue statement or omission,
     and make available copies of such supplement or amendment to the Investor.
     The Company shall also promptly notify the Investor (i) when a prospectus
     or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed,
     and when the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment has
     become effective; (ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments or
     supplements to the Registration Statement or related prospectus or related
     information, (iii) of the Company's reasonable determination that a
     post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement would be
     appropriate, (iv) in the event the Registration Statement is no longer
     effective, or (v) if the Registration Statement is stale as a result of the
     Company's failure to timely file its financials or otherwise

3.4  The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the
     issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of the
     Registration Statement, or the suspension of the qualification of any of
     the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction and, if such an
     order or suspension is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of such order or
     suspension at the earliest possible moment and to notify the Investor
     holding Registrable Securities being sold of the issuance of such order and
     the resolution thereof or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or

                                     -4-
<PAGE>

     threat of any proceeding concerning the effectiveness of the Registration
     Statement.

3.5  The Company shall permit the Investor and one (1) legal counsel, designated
     by the Investor, to review and comment upon the Registration Statement and
     all amendments and supplements thereto at least one (1) calendar day prior
     to their filing with the SEC. However, any postponement of a filing of a
     Registration Statement or any postponement of a request for acceleration or
     any postponement of the effective date or effectiveness of a Registration
     Statement by written request of the Investor (collectively, the "Investor's
     Delay") shall not act to trigger any penalty of any kind, or any cash
     amount due or any in-kind amount due the Investor from the Company under
     any and all agreements of any nature or kind between the Company and the
     Investor. The event(s) of an Investor's Delay shall act to suspend all
     obligations of any kind or nature of the Company under any and all
     agreements of any nature or kind between the Company and the Investor.

3.6  The Company shall hold in confidence and not make any disclosure of
     information concerning the Investor unless (i) disclosure of such
     information is necessary to comply with federal or state securities laws,
     (ii) the disclosure of such information is necessary to avoid or correct a
     misstatement or omission in any Registration Statement, (iii) the release
     of such information is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other final,
     non-appealable order from a court or governmental body of competent
     jurisdiction, or (iv) such information has been made generally available to
     the public other than by disclosure in violation of this Agreement or any
     other agreement. The Company agrees that it shall, upon learning that
     disclosure of such information concerning the Investor is sought in or by a
     court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction or through other
     means, give prompt written notice to the Investor and allow the Investor,
     at the Investor's expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent
     disclosure of, or to obtain a protective order covering such information.

3.7  The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
     designation and quotation of all the Registrable Securities covered by any
     Registration Statement on the Principal Market. If, despite the Company's
     commercially reasonable efforts, the Company is unsuccessful in satisfying
     the preceding sentence, it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
     cause all the Registrable Securities covered by any Registration Statement
     to be listed on each other national securities exchange and automated
     quotation system, if any, on which securities of the same class or series
     issued by the Company are then listed, if any, if the listing of such
     Registrable Securities is then permitted under the rules of such exchange
     or system. The Company shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with
     satisfying its obligation under this Section 3.7.

3.8  If requested by the Investor, the Company shall (i) as soon as reasonably
     practical incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective
     amendment such information as the Investor reasonably determines should be
     included therein relating to the sale and distribution of Registrable
     Securities, including, without limitation, information with respect to the
     offering of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering; (ii)
     make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective
     amendment as soon as reasonably possible after being notified of the
     matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective
     amendment; and (iii) supplement or make amendments to any Registration
     Statement if reasonably requested by the Investor.

3.9  The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
     Registrable Securities covered by the applicable Registration Statement to
                                     -5-

     be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or
     authorities as may be necessary to facilitate the disposition of such
     Registrable Securities.

3.10 The Company shall otherwise use all commercially reasonable efforts to
     comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC in connection
     with any registration hereunder.

3.11 The Company shall take all other reasonable actions necessary to expedite
     and facilitate disposition by the Investor of Registrable Securities
     pursuant to the Registration Statement.


                                   SECTION IV
                          OBLIGATIONS OF THE INVESTOR

4.1  At least five (5) calendar days prior to the first anticipated filing date
     of the Registration Statement, the Company shall notify the Investor in
     writing of the information the Company requires from the Investor for the
     Registration Statement. It shall be a condition precedent to the
     obligations of the Company to complete the registration pursuant to this
     Agreement with respect to the Registrable Securities and the Investor
     agrees to furnish to the Company that information regarding itself, the
     Registrable Securities and the intended method of disposition of the
     Registrable Securities as shall reasonably be required to effect the
     registration of such Registrable Securities and the Investor shall execute
     such documents in connection with such registration as the Company may
     reasonably request. The Investor covenants and agrees that, in connection
     with any sale of Registrable Securities by it pursuant to the Registration
     Statement, it shall comply with the "Plan of Distribution" section of the
     then current prospectus relating to such Registration Statement.

4.2  The Investor, by its acceptance of the Registrable Securities, agrees to
     cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested by the Company in
     connection with the preparation and filing of any Registration Statement
     hereunder, unless the Investor has notified the Company in writing of an
     election to exclude all of the Investor's Registrable Securities from such
     Registration Statement.

4.3  The Investor agrees that, upon receipt of written notice from the Company
     of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3.4 or the
     first sentence of Section 3.3, the Investor will immediately discontinue
     disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration
     Statement(s) covering such Registrable Securities until the Investor's
     receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
     contemplated by Section 3.4 or the first sentence of Section 3.3.


                                  SECTION V
                           EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION

All legal expenses of the Company incurred in connection with registrations
shall be paid by the Company.

                                  SECTION VI
                               INDEMNIFICATION

In the event any Registrable Securities are included in the Registration
Statement under this Agreement:

6.1  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, under this
     Agreement, will, and hereby does, indemnify, hold harmless and defend the
     Investor who holds Registrable Securities, the directors, officers,
     partners, employees, counsel, agents, representatives of, and each Person,
     if any, who controls, any Investor within the meaning of the 1933 Act or
     the 1934 Act (each, an "Indemnified Person"), against any losses, claims,
     damages, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, charges, costs,
     attorneys' fees, amounts paid in settlement or expenses, joint or several
     (collectively, "Claims"), incurred in investigating, preparing or defending
     any action, claim, suit, inquiry, proceeding, investigation or appeal taken
     from the foregoing by or before any court or governmental, administrative
     or other regulatory agency, body or the SEC, whether pending or threatened,
     whether or not an indemnified party is or may be a party thereto
     ("Indemnified Damages"), to which any of them may become subject insofar as
     such Claims (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in
     respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement
     or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in the Registration
     Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, or the omission or
     alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
     necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
     under which the statements therein were made, not misleading, (ii) any
     untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained
     in the final prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if the Company files
     any amendment thereof or supplement thereto with the SEC) or the omission
     or alleged omission to state therein any material fact necessary to make
     the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which the
     statements therein were made, not misleading, or (iii) any violation or
     alleged violation by the Company of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, any other
     law, including, without limitation, any state securities law, or any rule
     or regulation thereunder relating to the offer or sale of the Registrable
     Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement (the matters in the
     foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) being, collectively, "Violations").
     Subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 6.3 the Company shall
     reimburse the Investor and each such controlling person, promptly as such
     expenses are incurred and are due and payable, for any reasonable legal
     fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with
     investigating or defending any such Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the
     contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this
     Section 6.1: (i) shall not apply to a Claim arising out of or based upon a
     Violation which is due to the inclusion in the Registration Statement of
     the information furnished to the Company by any Indemnified Person
     expressly for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration
     Statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto; (ii) shall
     not be available to the extent such Claim is based on (a) a failure of the
     Investor to deliver or to cause to be delivered the prospectus made
     available by the Company or (b) the Indemnified Person's use of an
     incorrect prospectus despite being promptly advised in advance by the
     Company in writing not to use such incorrect prospectus; (iii) any claims
     based on the manner of sale of the Registrable Securities by the Investor
     or of the Investor's failure to register as a dealer under applicable
     securities laws; (iv) any omission of the Investor to notify the Company of
     any material fact that should be stated in the Registration Statement or
     prospectus relating to the Investor or the manner of sale; and (v) any
     amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected
                                     -7-
<PAGE>

     without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not
     be unreasonably withheld. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and
     effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
     Indemnified Person and shall survive the resale of the Registrable
     Securities by the Investor pursuant to the Registration Statemen.

6.2  In connection with any Registration Statement in which Investor is
     participating, the Investor agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend,
     to the same extent and in the same manner as is set forth in Section 6.1,
     the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the
     Registration Statement, each Person, if any, who controls the Company
     within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act and the Company's agents
     (collectively and together with an Indemnified Person, an "Indemnified
     Party"), against any Claim or Indemnified Damages to which any of them may
     become subject, under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, insofar as
     such Claim or Indemnified Damages arise out of or are based upon any
     Violation, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such
     Violation is due to the inclusion in the Registration Statement of the
     written information furnished to the Company by the Investor expressly for
     use in connection with such Registration Statement; and, subject to Section
     6.3, the Investor shall reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably
     incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such
     Claim; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this
     Section 6.2 and the agreement with respect to contribution contained in
     Section 7 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if
     such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the
     Investor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided,
     further, however, that the Investor shall only be liable under this Section
     6.2 for that amount of a Claim or Indemnified Damages as does not exceed
     the net proceeds to such Investor as a result of the sale of Registrable
     Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. Such indemnity shall
     remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or
     on behalf of such Indemnified Party and shall survive the resale of the
     Registrable Securities by the Investor pursuant to the Registration
     Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
     indemnification agreement contained in this Section 6.2 with respect to any
     preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Indemnified
     Party if the untrue statement or omission of material fact contained in the
     preliminary prospectus were corrected on a timely basis in the prospectus,
     as then amended or supplemented.

6.3  Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party
     under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action or
     proceeding (including any governmental action or proceeding) involving a
     Claim, such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall, if a Claim in
     respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this
     Section 6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the
     commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to
     participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires,
     jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume
     control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the
     indemnifying party and the Indemnified Person or the Indemnified Party, as
     the case may be; provided, however, that an Indemnified Person or
     Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the
     fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if, in the
     reasonable opinion of counsel retained by the Indemnified Person or
     Indemnified Party, the representation by counsel of the Indemnified Person
     or Indemnified Party and the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due
     to actual or potential differing interests between such Indemnified Person
     or Indemnified Party and any other party represented by such counsel in
                                     -8-
<PAGE>

     such proceeding. The indemnifying party shall pay for only one (1) separate
     legal counsel for the Indemnified Persons or the Indemnified Parties, as
     applicable, and such counsel shall be selected by the Investor, if the
     Investor is entitled to indemnification hereunder, or the Company, if the
     Company is entitled to indemnification hereunder, as applicable. The
     Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person shall cooperate fully with the
     indemnifying party in connection with any negotiation or defense of any
     such action or Claim by the indemnifying party and shall furnish to the
     indemnifying party all information reasonably available to the Indemnified
     Party or Indemnified Person which relates to such action or Claim. The
     indemnifying party shall keep the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person
     fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any
     settlement negotiations with respect thereto. No indemnifying party shall
     be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding affected
     without its written consent, provided, however, that the indemnifying party
     shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent. No
     indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the Indemnified Party or
     Indemnified Person, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
     settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional
     term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified
     Party or Indemnified Person of a release from all liability in respect to
     such Claim. Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the
     indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified
     Party or Indemnified Person with respect to all third parties, firms or
     corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been
     made. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party
     within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not
     relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the Indemnified Person
     or Indemnified Party under this Section 6, except to the extent that the
     indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.

6.4  The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to (i)
      any cause of action or similar right of the Indemnified Party or
      Indemnified Person against the indemnifying party or others, and (ii) any
      liabilities the indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law.


                                  SECTION VII
                                 CONTRIBUTION

7.1  To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is
     prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the
     maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would
     otherwise be liable under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law;
     provided, however, that: (i) no contribution shall be made under
     circumstances where the maker would not have been liable for
     indemnification under the fault standards set forth in Section 6; (ii) no
     seller of Registrable Securities guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
     (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to
     contribution from any seller of Registrable Securities who was not guilty
     of fraudulent misrepresentation; and (iii) contribution by any seller of
     Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of
     proceeds received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable
     Securities, or, if Registrable Securities are unsold, the value of such
     Registrable Securities.

                                 SECTION VIII
                          REPORTS UNDER THE 1934 ACT

8.1  With a view to making available to the Investor the benefits of Rule
     144 that may at any time permit the Investor to sell securities of the
     Company to the public without registration, provided that the Investor
     holds any Registrable Securities that are eligible for resale under Rule
     144, the Company agrees to:

        a.  make and keep public information available, as those terms are
            understood and defined in Rule 144;

        b.  file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents
            required of the Company under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act so long
            as the Company remains subject to such requirements and the filing
            of such reports and other documents is required for the applicable
            provisions of Rule 144; and

        c.  furnish to the Investor, promptly upon request, (i) a written
            statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting
            requirements of Rule 144, the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act and (ii)
            such other information as may be reasonably requested to permit the
            Investor to sell such securities pursuant to Rule 144 without
            registration.


                                    SECTION IX

     which, when so executed, shall be deemed an original, but all such

     possible, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions
     of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

     connection herewith agree to submit to the in personam jurisdiction of such
     courts. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other

     it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such
     statute or rule of law. Any such provision which may prove invalid or
     unenforceable under any law shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of any other provision of any agreement. Each party hereby irrevocably
                                     -11-

                                     (Two Pages)


The undersigned, MICHELE CIAVARELLA, is the duly elected Chief Executive Officer
of Empire Global Corp, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

I hereby warrant and represent that I have undertaken a complete and thorough
review of the Company's corporate and financial books and records, including,
but not limited to, the Company's records relating to the following:

(A)  The execution of that certain Investment Agreement and Registration Rights
     Agreement dated July 20, 2015 (the "Investment Agreement Date") with
     Tangiers Investment Group, LLC (the "Investor") to invest up to the amount
     of $5,000,000 (the "Investment Agreement");

(B)  The Company's Board of Directors duly approved the Investment Agreement
     with the Investor;

(C)  To my best knowledge and after completing the aforementioned review of the
     Company's stockholder and corporate records, I am able to certify that the
     Investor (and the persons affiliated with the Investor) are not officers,
     directors, or directly or indirectly, ten percent (10.00%) or more
     stockholders of the Company and none of said persons has had any such
     status in the one hundred (100) days immediately preceding the date of this
     Certificate;

(D)  The Company's Board of Directors have approved duly adopted resolutions
