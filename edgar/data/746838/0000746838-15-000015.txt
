UNISYS ANNOUNCES SECOND-QUARTER 2015 FINANCIAL RESULTS

* Revenue of $765 million: Down 5 percent year over year; Up 4 percent in
constant currency(1)
* Diluted loss per share of $1.17 vs diluted loss per share of $0.24 in
2Q 2014; Reflects charge of $0.97 per share related to the first phase of
the previously announced  cost reduction actions
* Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share(2) of $0.33 vs $0.11 in 2Q 2014

BLUE BELL, Pa., July 23, 2015 - Unisys Corporation (NYSE: UIS) today
reported a second-quarter 2015 net loss of $58.2 million, or $1.17 per
diluted share, which included cost reduction charges of $48.6 million and
$25.9 million of pension expense. In the second quarter of 2014, the
company reported a net loss of $12.1 million, or $0.24 per diluted share,
which included $17.9 million of pension expense. Excluding cost reduction
charges and pension expense in both periods, the non-GAAP diluted
earnings per share in the second quarter of 2015 increased to $0.33 from
$0.11 in the second quarter of 2014.

Second-quarter 2015 revenue declined 5 percent to $765 million from $806
million in the year-ago quarter. On a constant currency basis second-
quarter 2015 revenue grew 4 percent.

"We were pleased to see solid revenue growth on a constant currency basis
during the quarter," said Unisys President and CEO Peter Altabef. "We are
aggressively implementing our new operating model to be a more nimble,
focused and responsive company that anticipates and rapidly responds to
market opportunities globally."

The company is implementing organizational initiatives designed to reduce
its cost structure and rebalance the company's global skill set to take
advantage of growth opportunities. These actions are estimated to
generate annualized savings of approximately $200 million by the end of
2016. As previously announced, Unisys expects to recognize a pretax
restructuring charge estimated at approximately $300 million over the
next several quarters. The first of these charges, totaling $53 million,
is reflected in the second quarter 2015 results.

SECOND-QUARTER COMPANY AND BUSINESS SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS

Revenue from the Government sector, which represented 44 percent of the
quarter's revenue, was up 3 percent and 10 percent on a constant currency
basis. Government sector revenue was driven by strong performance from
the U.S. Federal government group which grew 32 percent. Revenue from the
Commercial sector was 34 percent of the quarter's revenue and declined 4
percent, but was up 8 percent on a constant currency basis. Revenue from
the Financial Services sector was 22 percent of the quarter's revenue and
declined 19 percent, down 11 percent on a constant currency basis.

Geographically, U.S. and Canada revenue rose 23 percent in the quarter.
Revenue from the rest of the world declined 24 percent and 10 percent on
a constant currency basis.

Second-quarter 2015 services revenue declined 6 percent from the prior-
year quarter. On a constant currency basis, services revenue rose 3
percent led by growth in application services.

Second-quarter 2015 services orders decreased from year-ago levels due to
lower orders for cloud and infrastructure services in the U.S. and
Canada. Services backlog at June 30, 2015 was $4.4 billion compared to
$4.8 billion at December 31, 2014 and $4.7 billion at June 30, 2014.

Second-quarter 2015 technology revenue was flat versus the prior-year
quarter and increased by 10 percent on a constant currency basis.

The company reported an overall second-quarter 2015 gross profit margin
of 16.3 percent compared with 20.5 percent in the year-ago quarter. This
420 basis point decline included 270 basis points related to the cost
reduction charges and increased pension expense. The remaining 150 basis
point decline included 90 basis points caused by currency fluctuations
and 60 basis points that reflected lower services and technology margins
explained below, partially offset by a higher percentage of our overall
revenue coming from technology.

Second-quarter 2015 services gross profit margin decreased to 15.7
percent from 16.9 percent a year ago. This 120 basis point decline
included 60 basis points related to negative currency fluctuations. The
remaining 60 basis point reduction was attributable to higher transition
costs in cloud and infrastructure services, partially offset by increased
gross margins from the growth in application services.

Second-quarter 2015 technology gross profit margin decreased to 43.9
percent from 49.8 percent in the year-ago quarter. Currency fluctuations
negatively affected technology gross margins by 430 basis points. The
remaining 160 basis points decline reflected a higher proportion of
revenue from non-proprietary technology.

Operating expenses (SG&A and R&D expenses) included $39.2 million of the
cost reduction charges in the second quarter 2015. Excluding these
charges, operating expenses declined 10 percent from the year-ago period,
down 1 percent on a constant currency basis.

The company reported a second-quarter 2015 pretax loss of $50.8 million
compared with pretax income of $11.0 million in the year-ago quarter.
Excluding the cost reduction charges and pension expense in both periods,
the company reported a non-GAAP pretax profit(3) of $28.2 million in the
second quarter of 2015 compared with $28.9 million in the second quarter
of 2014.

CASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS

Unisys generated $72.3 million in adjusted EBITDA(4) in the second
quarter of 2015 compared to $76.9 million in the second quarter of 2014.
The company used $21 million of cash from operations in the second
quarter of 2015 including cost reduction payments of $13 million and
pension contributions of $37 million. During the second quarter of 2014,
cash from operations totaled $3 million including pension contributions
of $48 million. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2015 were
$54 million compared with $45 million in the year-ago quarter.

At June 30, 2015, the company reported a cash balance of $365 million and
total debt of $256 million.

NON-GAAP INFORMATION

Unisys reports its results in accordance with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States. However, in an effort
to provide investors with additional perspective regarding the company's
results as determined by GAAP, the company also discusses, in its
earnings press release and/or earnings presentation materials, non-GAAP
information which management believes provides useful information to
investors. Our management uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures
internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and assess
operational alternatives. These non-GAAP measures may include constant
currency, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP pretax profit,
and adjusted EBITDA.

Our non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or
as substitutes for results determined in accordance with GAAP and should
be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP. (See GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations
attached.)

(1) Constant currency - The company refers to growth rates at constant
currency or adjusting for currency so that the business results can be
viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates to facilitate comparisons of the company's business performance
from one period to another. Constant currency for revenue is calculated
by retranslating current and prior period results at a consistent rate.
This approach is based on the pricing currency for each country which is
typically the functional currency. Generally, when the dollar either
strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant
currency rates will be higher or lower, respectively, than growth
reported at actual exchange rates.

(2) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share - Unisys recorded pension
expense, net of tax, of $25.9 million and $17.9 million during the second
quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. Unisys recorded a charge, net of
tax, of $48.6 million in connection with cost reduction actions during
the second quarter of 2015. In an effort to provide investors with a
perspective on the company's earnings without these charges, they are
excluded from the non-GAAP diluted earnings/loss per share calculations.

(3) Non-GAAP pretax profit - Unisys recorded pension expense of $26.4
million and $17.9 million during the second quarters of 2015 and 2014,
respectively. Unisys recorded a pretax charge of $52.6 million in
connection with cost reduction actions during the second quarter of 2015.
In an effort to provide investors with a perspective on the company's
profitability without these charges, they are excluded from the non-GAAP
pretax profit/loss calculations.

(4) Adjusted EBITDA - Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and
Amortization (EBITDA) is an approximate measure of a company's operating
cash flow based on data from the company's income statement. EBITDA is
calculated as earnings before the deduction of net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests, other (income) expense, net, interest expense,
taxes, depreciation, and amortization and non-cash share-based expense.
Management believes this measure may be relevant to investors due to the
level of fixed assets and related depreciation charges. This measure is
also of interest to the company's creditors, since it provides a
perspective on earnings available for interest payments. Unisys recorded
pretax pension expense of $26.4 million and $17.9 million, respectively,
during the second quarters of 2015 and 2014. During the second quarter of
2015, Unisys recorded a pretax charge of $52.6 million in connection with
cost reduction actions. In order to provide investors with additional
understanding of the company's operating results, these charges are
excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA calculation.

statements for the reporting period. Additional discussion of factors
