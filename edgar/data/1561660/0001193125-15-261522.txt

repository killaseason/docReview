out of or relating to this Agreement, the Prospectus, the Registration Statement, or the offering of the Shares. The Underwriters and the Company irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Shares to be sold by such party: (i)&nbsp;the Underwriters have acted at
arm&#146;s length, are not agents of, and have assumed no, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company, (ii)&nbsp;the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the
extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii)&nbsp;the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims they may have against the
Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">16. <I>Judgment
Currency</I>. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder into any currency other than United States dollars, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate
of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Underwriters could purchase United States dollars with such other currency in The City of New York on the business day preceding that on which final
judgment is given. The obligation of the Company with respect to any sum due from it to any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than United States dollars, not be discharged
until the first business day following receipt by such Underwriter or controlling person of any sum in such other currency, and only to the extent that such Underwriter or controlling person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase
United States dollars with such other currency. If the United States dollars so purchased are less than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person hereunder and the Company agree as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any
such judgment, to indemnify such Underwriter or controlling person against such loss. If the United States dollars so purchased are greater than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person hereunder, such Underwriter or
controlling person agrees to pay to the Company an amount equal to the excess of the dollars so purchased over the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person hereunder. </P>

July&nbsp;22, 2015 (the &#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;) with you and the other several Initial Purchasers named in Schedule A thereto under which you and such other Initial Purchasers have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $225,000,000
aggregate principal amount of its 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the &#147;Notes&#148;). [The Notes include $[&#9679;] aggregate principal amount of the Company&#146;s 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 to be purchased pursuant to the
over-allotment option provided for by the Purchase Agreement.] The Notes are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture dated as of July&nbsp;28, 2015 (the &#147;Indenture&#148;) among the Company, the Guarantor and Deutsche Bank Trust
Company Americas, as trustee, and are convertible on the terms set forth in the Indenture into cash and/or shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the &#147;Underlying Securities&#148;), of the Company. The Notes will be

conclusions expressed above or (ii)&nbsp;any provision of the Indenture that purports to avoid the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law by limiting the amount of any Guarantor&#146;s obligation,
(y)&nbsp;the validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of Section [14.03] of the Indenture or any related provision in the Securities that requires or relates to adjustments to the conversion rate at a rate or in an amount that a court
would determine in the circumstances under applicable law to be commercially unreasonable or a penalty or forfeiture or (z)&nbsp;the validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision that permits holders to collect any portion of

necessary in connection with the offer, sale and delivery of the Securities to the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement or in connection with the initial resale of such Securities by the Initial Purchasers in the manner contemplated by
the Purchase Agreement and the Final Memorandum to register the Securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or to qualify the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, it being understood that no opinion is expressed
as to any subsequent offer or resale of any Security or Underlying Security. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">7. The Company is not, and after giving effect to the

1940, as amended. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">8. The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the

(i)&nbsp;any provision of the laws of the State of New York or any federal law of the United States of America that in our experience is normally applicable to general business corporations in relation to transactions of the type contemplated by the
Documents, or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, provided that we express no opinion as to federal or state securities laws, (ii)&nbsp;the certificate of incorporation, by-laws,

Documents, or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company or the Guarantor of its respective obligations under the

considered the statements included in the Final Memorandum under the caption &#147;Description of Notes&#148; insofar as they summarize provisions of the Indenture and the Securities and under the caption &#147;Description of Capital Stock&#148;
insofar as they summarize provisions of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company. In our opinion, such statements fairly summarize these provisions in all material respects. The statements included in the Final Memorandum under
the caption &#147;Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,&#148; insofar as they purport to describe provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws or legal conclusions with respect thereto, in our opinion are accurate in all material respects.

upon such party, provided that we make no such assumption to the extent that we have specifically opined as to such matters with respect to the Company and the Guarantor, and (ii)&nbsp;each Document (other than the Purchase Agreement) is a valid,

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Pattern Energy Announces Pricing of Private Offering of Convertible Senior Notes </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA &#150; July&nbsp;22, 2015 &#150; Pattern Energy Group Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Pattern Energy&#148;) (NASDAQ: PEGI)
(TSX: PEG) today announced the pricing of $225&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of its 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the &#147;Notes&#148;) in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), and the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws (the &#147;Notes Offering&#148;). The Company has granted the initial purchasers of the Notes Offering a
30-day option to purchase up to an additional $33.75&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of Notes solely to cover over-allotments, if any. The Notes Offering is expected to close on July&nbsp;28, 2015, subject to customary closing conditions.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Notes Offering, together with the net proceeds from a concurrent underwritten public offering of
approximately $125 million, or 5,435,000 shares, of its Class&nbsp;A common stock (&#147;Class A Shares&#148;) at a public offering price of $23.00 per share (the &#147;Public Offering Price&#148;), for the repayment of a portion of the outstanding
indebtedness incurred in connection with the Company&#146;s purchase of interests in the K2, Lost Creek and Post Rock wind projects, the acquisition of non-controlling interests in the Gulf Wind project, the prepayment of Gulf Wind project level
indebtedness and general corporate purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes will be unsecured obligations of the Company and will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by
Pattern US Finance Company LLC. The Notes will mature on July&nbsp;15, 2020, unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date, and will bear interest at a rate of 4.00%&nbsp;per year, payable semiannually in arrears
on January&nbsp;15 and July&nbsp;15 of each year, beginning on January&nbsp;15, 2016. The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to maturity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes
will be convertible into Class&nbsp;A Shares at an initial conversion rate of 35.4925 Class&nbsp;A Shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $28.175 per Class&nbsp;A Share and
represents an approximately 22.5% conversion premium over the Public Offering Price. Conversions of the Notes will be settled, at the Company&#146;s election, in cash, Class&nbsp;A Shares or a combination thereof. Upon the occurrence of certain
fundamental changes, holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the repurchase date. For Notes converted in connection with certain fundamental changes, the Company will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for the converted Notes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes are being offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been registered under
the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. In Canada, the Notes may be offered on a prospectus-exempt basis to accredited investors (as

or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall it constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. </P>
