wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<U>Merger Sub</U>&#148;) and the Company (the &#147;<U>Merger Agreement</U>&#148;), dated July 20, 2015, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;), with
the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, the Company entered into letter agreement amendments (each, an &#147;<U>Amendment</U>&#148;) on July 19, 2015 with Mr. Gregory S. Butterfield to amend his involuntary
termination protection agreement, dated as of June 27, 2014, and Mr. Dana Russell to amend his involuntary termination protection agreement, dated as of June 26, 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the Amendments, upon the effective time of the Merger (the &#147;<U>Effective Time</U>&#148;) the involuntary termination

protection agreements will continue in full force and effect during Messrs. Butterfield&#146;s and Russell&#146;s employment or service with the Company or any affiliate and for the one-year period thereafter. Pursuant to the terms of the
Amendments, Messrs. Butterfield and Russell agreed that the consummation of the Merger alone will not constitute a material diminution in their title, duties, authority, reporting position or responsibilities measured in the aggregate for purposes
of the &#147;good reason&#148; definition in the applicable involuntary termination protection agreement. In addition, Mr.&nbsp;Russell&#146;s Amendment amended the definition of &#147;good reason&#148; in his involuntary termination protection
agreement which definition will apply following the Effective Time under the involuntary termination protection agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to
the Amendments, after the Effective Time Mr.&nbsp;Butterfield will be granted an award of 700,000 restricted stock units in respect of common stock of Parent (&#147;<U>Parent Common Stock</U>&#148;) and Mr.&nbsp;Russell will be granted an award of
225,000 restricted stock units in respect of Parent Common Stock. The restricted stock unit award grants will vest as follows: ten percent (10%)&nbsp;on December&nbsp;31, 2017, forty-five percent (45%)&nbsp;on December&nbsp;31, 2018, and the
remaining forty-five percent (45%)&nbsp;on December&nbsp;31, 2019. Subject to the compensation committee&#146;s discretion to accelerate vesting, all unvested restricted stock units will be immediately forfeited upon a termination of employment for
any reason. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Amendments provide that thirty percent (30%)&nbsp;of Mr.&nbsp;Butterfield&#146;s options to purchase shares of common
stock of the Company (&#147;<U>Company Common Stock</U>&#148;) and twenty percent (20%)&nbsp;of Mr.&nbsp;Russell&#146;s options to purchase Company Common Stock, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into an unvested option to purchase
shares of Parent Common Stock. The options to purchase Parent Common Stock will vest fifty percent (50%) on each of the first and second anniversaries of the Effective Time; provided that one hundred percent (100%)&nbsp;will vest upon Messrs.
Butterfield&#146;s or Russell&#146;s termination of employment by the Company for any reason other than &#147;cause&#148; or by Messrs. Butterfield or Russell for &#147;good reason&#148; (as defined in the applicable Amendment). </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including with respect to the timing of the completion of the acquisition and the ability of SunEdison to finance aspects of the acquisition, and typically can be identified by the use of words such as
&#147;expect,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;forecast,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; &#147;target,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;believe&#148; and similar terms and expressions. Forward-looking statements
are based on current expectations and assumptions. Although Vivint Solar believes that its expectations and assumptions are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these expectations and assumptions will prove to have been correct, and actual
results may vary materially. For example, (1)&nbsp;Vivint Solar may be unable to obtain the stockholder approval required for the merger; (2)&nbsp;the companies may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals required for the merger, or required
regulatory approvals may delay the merger or result in the imposition of conditions that could have a material adverse effect on the combined company or cause the companies to abandon the merger; (3)&nbsp;conditions to the closing of the merger may
not be satisfied; (4)&nbsp;an unsolicited offer of another company to acquire assets or capital stock of Vivint Solar could interfere with the merger; (5)&nbsp;SunEdison may be unable to obtain the financing for which it has received commitments or
to complete the sale of assets contemplated by the TERP Purchase Agreement; (6)&nbsp;problems may arise in integration, which may result in less effective or efficient operations; (7)&nbsp;the merger may involve unexpected costs, unexpected
liabilities or unexpected delays, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from the companies&#146; expectations; (8)&nbsp;the credit ratings of the combined company or its subsidiaries may be different from what SunEdison, Terraform
Power, Inc. (&#147;<U>TerraForm Power</U>&#148;) or Vivint Solar expect; (9)&nbsp;the businesses of the companies may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the merger and the related transactions; (10)&nbsp;the industry may be subject to
future regulatory or legislative actions that could adversely affect the companies; and (11)&nbsp;the companies may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You
should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties that affect the businesses of Vivint Solar, SunEdison and TerraForm Power described in the &#147;Risk Factors&#148; section of their respective Annual Reports on
Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents filed by either of them from time to time with the SEC. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based upon information available to Vivint Solar, SunEdison and
TerraForm Power on the date hereof, and none of Vivint Solar, SunEdison or TerraForm Power assumes any obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of
activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in those statements will be achieved or will occur, and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Except as required by
law, Vivint Solar does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. You should read the documents Vivint Solar has filed with the
SEC for more complete information about the company. These documents are available on both the EDGAR section of the SEC&#146;s website at www.sec.gov and the Investor Relations section of the company&#146;s website at www.vivintsolar.com. </P>

behalf of nearly 4,000 team members across the country, I&#146;d like to introduce Vivint Solar, and express how excited we are to join you after completion of the merger. </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>We&#146;ve respected and admired your company and culture from a distance, and now I&#146;d like to tell you a little about ours.</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>We&#146;re young, we&#146;re motivated, and as you&#146;ll see, we like to zig when others zag. And while we&#146;re not big on formality, we&#146;ve built
a culture on working hard and doing good. </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Along the way, we&#146;ve taken the residential solar market by storm, and I believe there are a few
reasons why:</I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>We like to make solar simple. </I></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including with respect to the timing of the completion of the acquisition and the ability of SunEdison to finance aspects of the acquisition, and typically can be identified by the use of words such as
&#147;expect,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;forecast,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; &#147;target,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;believe&#148; and similar terms and expressions. Forward-looking statements
are based on current expectations and assumptions. Although Vivint Solar believes that its expectations and assumptions are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these expectations and assumptions will prove to have been correct, and actual
results may vary materially. For example, (1)&nbsp;Vivint Solar may be unable to obtain the stockholder approval required for the merger; (2)&nbsp;the companies may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals required for the merger, or required
regulatory approvals may delay the merger or result in the imposition of conditions that could have a material adverse effect on the combined company or cause the companies to abandon the merger; (3)&nbsp;conditions to the closing of the merger may
not be satisfied; (4)&nbsp;an unsolicited offer of another company to acquire assets or capital stock of Vivint Solar could interfere with the merger; (5)&nbsp;SunEdison may be unable to obtain the financing for which it has received commitments or
to complete the sale of assets contemplated by the TERP Purchase Agreement; (6)&nbsp;problems may arise in integration, which may result in less effective or efficient operations; (7)&nbsp;the merger may involve unexpected costs, unexpected
liabilities or unexpected delays, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from the companies&#146; expectations; (8)&nbsp;the credit ratings of the combined company or its subsidiaries may be different from what SunEdison, Terraform
Power, Inc. (&#147;<U>TerraForm Power</U>&#148;) or Vivint Solar expect; (9)&nbsp;the businesses of the companies may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the merger and the related transactions; (10)&nbsp;the industry may be subject to
future regulatory or legislative actions that could adversely affect the companies; and (11)&nbsp;the companies may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You
should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties that affect the businesses of Vivint Solar, SunEdison and TerraForm Power described in the &#147;Risk Factors&#148; section of their respective Annual Reports on
Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents filed by either of them from time to time with the SEC. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based upon information available to Vivint Solar, SunEdison and
TerraForm Power on the date hereof, and none of Vivint Solar, SunEdison or TerraForm Power assumes any obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of
activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in those statements will be achieved or will occur, and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Except as required by
law, Vivint Solar does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. You should read the documents Vivint Solar has filed with the
SEC for more complete information about the company. These documents are available on both the EDGAR section of the SEC&#146;s website at www.sec.gov and the Investor Relations section of the company&#146;s website at www.vivintsolar.com. </P>
