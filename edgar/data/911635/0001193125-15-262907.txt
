<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As previously disclosed, on April&nbsp;22, 2015, Associated Estates Realty Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) by and among the Company, BSREP II Aries Pooling LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#147;Brookfield&#148;), and BSREP II Aries DE Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Brookfield (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed in connection with a Memorandum of Understanding (the &#147;MOU&#148;) regarding the settlement
of certain litigation related to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein (the &#147;merger&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As contemplated
by the MOU, the Company is providing certain disclosures in addition to those contained in the definitive proxy statement mailed on or about June&nbsp;22, 2015 (the &#147;proxy statement&#148;) to the Company&#146;s shareholders of record as of the
close of business on June&nbsp;22, 2015 in connection with the solicitation of proxies for use at the special meeting of shareholders of the Company to be held on August&nbsp;5, 2015, at 10:00 A.M., local time, at The Union Club, 1211 Euclid Avenue,
Cleveland, Ohio 44115. The purpose of the special meeting is to consider and vote on (1)&nbsp;a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (2)&nbsp;a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the executive officer compensation that will
or may be paid to the Company&#146;s named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3)&nbsp;a proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies in the event there are not sufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Company&#146;s board of directors previously fixed June&nbsp;22, 2015 as the record date for the purpose of determining the shareholders who are entitled to receive notice
of, and to vote at (in person or by proxy), the special meeting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s board of directors unanimously determined that the
Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders, and unanimously recommended that the Company&#146;s shareholders
vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>THE ASSOCIATED ESTATES BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE &#147;FOR&#148; THE

shareholder derivative lawsuits, captioned Cutler v. Friedman, et al., No.&nbsp;1:15-cv-00857, and Berkman v. Friedman, et. al., No.&nbsp;1:15-cv-00928, were filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Ohio in connection with the announcement of the merger. Two putative class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits, captioned Witkowski v. Associated Estates Realty Corp., et. al., No. CV 15 845978, and Kessler
v. Associated Estates Realty Corp., et al., No. CV 15 845987, also were filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, Ohio. The lawsuits, filed by purported shareholders of the Company, challenge the proposed merger and allege, among other
things, that the Company&#146;s directors breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders by engaging in a flawed sale process, agreeing to a transaction price that does not adequately compensate shareholders, and agreeing to certain unfair deal
protection terms. The complaints also allege that Parent and Merger Sub have aided and abetted the directors&#146; breaches of fiduciary duties. Among other things, the shareholder litigation seeks to enjoin the merger. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The two District Court actions were consolidated by order of the Court dated July&nbsp;2, 2015, and the consolidated action is now governed by
an amended complaint that includes, in addition to the fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting claims, claims against all defendants for violation of disclosure requirements of federal proxy law and rules, specifically sections&nbsp;14(a) and 20(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and associated SEC Rule 14a-9. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Associated Estates, Brookfield, Merger Sub, and their respective
directors believe that the shareholder litigation and the underlying claims are without merit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July <B></B>24<B></B>, 2015, counsel for
the parties in the above-described lawsuits entered into the MOU, in which they agreed on the terms of a settlement that would dispose of all actions in both federal and state courts, including the dismissal with prejudice of the actions and a
release of all claims made therein against all defendants. The proposed settlement is conditioned upon, among other things, the execution of an appropriate stipulation of settlement, consummation of the merger, and final court approval of the
proposed settlement following notice and hearing. In addition, in connection with the settlement and as provided in the MOU, the parties contemplate that plaintiffs&#146; counsel will seek an award of attorneys&#146; fees and expenses as part of the
settlement. There can be no assurance that the merger will be consummated, that the parties ultimately will enter into a stipulation of settlement, or that the settlement will receive court approval even if the parties enter into such stipulation.
If the settlement conditions are not met, the proposed settlement as contemplated by the MOU would become void. The settlement will not affect the amount of the merger consideration that Associated Estates stockholders are entitled to receive in the
merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The defendants deny all fault or liability, and deny that they have committed any unlawful or wrongful act alleged in the actions

redevelopment activities to achieve expected results due to, among other causes, construction and contracting risks; unanticipated increases in materials and/or labor, and delays in project completion and/or lease-up that result in increased costs
