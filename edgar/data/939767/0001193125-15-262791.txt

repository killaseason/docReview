shares of its Common Stock (see Item&nbsp;8.01 below),&nbsp;disclosed that, although it has not finalized its consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended July&nbsp;3, 2015, it expects to report that it had $167.0 million of cash and
investments as of July&nbsp;3, 2015, which included $76.6 million available for operations, $6.1 million of short-term restricted investments for public debt service obligations, $81.6 million of compensating balance investments that it is required
to maintain on deposit with Silicon Valley Bank, and $2.7 million of long-term restricted investments. These amounts are preliminary, the actual amounts that the Company reports will be subject to its financial closing procedures and any final
adjustments that may be made prior to the time its financial results for the quarter ended July&nbsp;3, 2015, are finalized. Additional information and disclosures would be required for a more complete understanding of the Company&#146;s financial
position and results of operations as of July&nbsp;3, 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Item&nbsp;8.01 Other Events. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&nbsp;23, 2015, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the &#147;Underwriting Agreement&#148;) with Cowen and Company, LLC,

stock, par value $0.001 per share. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriters have agreed to purchase the shares of common stock from the Company at a price of $5.076 per share, which will result in $126.9 million of proceeds to the
Company before deducting offering expenses. The offering is expected to close on or about July&nbsp;29, 2015, subject to customary closing conditions. The shares of common stock will be listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market. The Underwriters
have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,750,000 shares of common stock. All of the shares in the offering are being sold by the Company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Offering is being made pursuant to the Company&#146;s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration
No.&nbsp;333-205397) previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;). The Company has filed a final prospectus supplement, dated July&nbsp;23, 2015, relating to the issuance and sale of the shares with the SEC.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company, customary conditions to closing,
indemnification obligations of the Company and the Underwriters, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, other obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The representations, warranties and covenants
contained in the Underwriting Agreement were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties.
