amended (the<I> &#147;Prior Plan&#148;</I>) will terminate on the date of such shareholder approval, and no new awards will be granted under the Prior Plan after its termination date; provided that the Prior Plan will continue to govern awards
issued under the Prior Plan which are outstanding as of the date of the Prior Plan&#146;s termination and such awards shall continue in force and effect until fully distributed or terminated pursuant to their terms. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">2.<B> Definitions.</B> Capitalized terms used in this Plan have the meanings given below. Additional defined terms are set forth in other

the Plan in connection with any Award or Account, in whole or in part, unless and until certificates for such Shares shall have been issued. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b)
<U>Transferability of Awards</U>. No Award, and no right under any such Award, shall be assignable, alienable, saleable or transferable by an employee Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. No Award, and no
right under any such Award, shall be assignable, alienable, saleable or transferable by a Director Participant otherwise than: (i)&nbsp;by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; (ii)&nbsp;to a trust for the benefit of the Director or his

or legal representative. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) <U>No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements</U>. Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting or

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(d) <U>Governing Law</U>. The validity, constrictions and effect of this Plan, agreements entered into pursuant to this Plan, and of any rules, regulations,
determinations or decisions made by the Administrator relating to this Plan or such agreements, and the rights of any and all persons having or claiming to have any interest therein or thereunder, shall be determined exclusively in accordance with
applicable federal laws and the laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(e) <U>Severability</U>. If any provision
of the Plan or any Award Agreement is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person, Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Administrator,
such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Administrator, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such
provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect. </P>

create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive an Award, or Shares pursuant to an Award, from the Company
pursuant to this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(g) <U>Withholding</U>. The

of the Company may at any election fail or refuse to elect any Participant to the Board free from any liability or claim under this Plan or any Award. </P>
