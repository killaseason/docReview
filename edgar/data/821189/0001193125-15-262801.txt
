(EOG) entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (New Facility) among EOG, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, the financial institutions as bank parties thereto (Banks) and the other parties thereto.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The New Facility replaces EOG&#146;s $2.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of October&nbsp;11, 2011, among
EOG, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, the financial institutions as bank parties thereto and the other parties thereto (2011 Facility), which had a scheduled maturity date of October&nbsp;11, 2016 and which was terminated by EOG
(without penalty), effective as of July&nbsp;21, 2015, in connection with the completion of the New Facility. There were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the 2011 Facility as of the closing of the New Facility and the termination
of the 2011 Facility. The 2011 Facility is referenced under Item&nbsp;9.01 below and on the exhibit index hereto. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The New Facility has a
scheduled maturity date of July&nbsp;21, 2020 and includes an option for EOG to extend, on up to two occasions, the term for successive one-year periods, subject to, among certain other terms and conditions, the consent of the Banks holding greater
than 50% of the commitments then outstanding under the New Facility. The New Facility commits the Banks to provide advances up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion at any one time outstanding, with an option for EOG to request increases
in the aggregate commitments to an amount not to exceed $3.0 billion, subject to certain terms and conditions. Advances under the New Facility will accrue interest based, at EOG&#146;s option, on either the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus
an applicable margin, or the base rate (as defined in the New Facility) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin used in connection with interest rates and fees will be based on EOG&#146;s credit rating for its senior unsecured long-term
debt at the applicable time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the New Facility provides for a Canadian dollar sub-facility and a Sterling sub-facility,
pursuant to which a Canadian subsidiary of EOG (EOG Canada Oil&nbsp;&amp; Gas Inc.) and a United Kingdom subsidiary of EOG (EOG Resources United Kingdom Limited), respectively, each can obtain advances in such respective currencies up to an
aggregate principal amount of the U.S. dollar equivalent of $150.0 million (which amount is included in, and is not in addition to, the $2.0 billion aggregate commitments). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The New Facility contains representations, warranties, covenants and events of default that are customary for investment grade, senior
unsecured commercial bank credit agreements, including a financial covenant for the maintenance of a total debt-to-total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing description of the New Facility does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the New
Facility, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. </P>

independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. Each Debtor agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such
