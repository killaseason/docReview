Press Release

STOCK TRADED:  NYSE			FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
TICKER SYMBOL: TR			Thursday, July 23, 2015



CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - July 23, 2015 - Ellen R. Gordon, Chairman,
Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. reported second quarter and first half
2015 net sales and net earnings.

Second quarter 2015 net sales were $107,528,000 compared to
$104,061,000 in second quarter 2014, an increase of $3,467,000 or 3%.
Second quarter 2015 net earnings were $11,059,000 compared to
$9,026,000 in second quarter 2014, and net earnings per share were
$.18 and $.14 in second quarter 2015 and 2014, respectively, an
increase of $.04 per share or 29%.

First half 2015 net sales were $213,005,000 compared to $210,873,000
in first half 2014, an increase of $2,132,000 or 1%. First half 2015
net earnings were $20,213,000 compared to $18,607,000 in first half
2014, and net earnings per share were $.33 and $.30 in first half
2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $.03 per share or 10%.

Mrs. Gordon said, "Second quarter and first half 2015 net sales and
net earnings benefited from successful marketing and sales programs,
product line extensions and new products. Net earnings were favorably
impacted by a foreign income tax settlement and resulting lower
effective income tax rate which added $1,066,000 or approximately
$.02 per share to both second quarter and first half net earnings.
Lower distribution expense resulting from declining energy and fuel
costs, improving manufacturing plant efficiencies driven by capital
investments, and ongoing cost containment programs also contributed
to improved results and mitigated other cost increases during the
comparative periods. Although our overall comparative ingredient
costs in both second quarter and first half 2015 were generally in
line with the corresponding periods in 2014, certain key ingredient
costs are higher this year. The Company's second quarter and first
half 2015 net earnings per share benefited from common stock
purchases in the open market resulting in fewer shares outstanding."
