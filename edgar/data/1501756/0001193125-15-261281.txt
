Board also announced that it has commenced a search process to identify a successor. Hans P. Hull, Senior Vice President, Business Operations, has been named interim Chief Executive Officer and President to lead the Company while the search for a
permanent Chief Executive Officer is conducted. Dr.&nbsp;Chalberg will continue with the Company as a consultant and member of the Company&#146;s Scientific Advisory Board. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dr.&nbsp;Chalberg and the Company are parties to a Change in Control and Severance Agreement, dated November&nbsp;5, 2014 (the

as a consultant and Scientific Advisor, however, Dr.&nbsp;Chalberg and the Company have entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release, dated July&nbsp;23, 2015 (the &#147;<U>Separation Agreement</U>&#148;). Under the Separation Agreement,
Dr.&nbsp;Chalberg will provide consulting services to the Company until the first anniversary of July&nbsp;23, 2015 (the &#147;<U>consulting period</U>&#148;), devoting up to 32 hours per week during the first three months and up to 20 hours per

the Company&#146;s common stock subject to his outstanding equity awards that were otherwise scheduled to vest following the expiration of the consulting period will not vest under any circumstances and have been forfeited. If a Change in Control
(as defined in the Severance Agreement) occurs during the consulting period, Dr.&nbsp;Chalberg will automatically vest in those equity awards that would otherwise have vested during the consulting period. The consulting arrangement is terminable by
either party upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days&#146; written notice, with accelerated vesting of Dr.&nbsp;Chalberg&#146;s equity awards and continued payment of his consulting fee in full if the Company terminates the consulting arrangement without Cause
or he terminates for Good Reason (each as defined in the Separation Agreement). The Separation Agreement contains, or incorporates from the Severance Agreement, noncompetition, nonsolicitation, confidentiality and mutual nondisparagement provisions,
mutual releases of certain claims, and provisions relating to sales of securities of the Company by Dr.&nbsp;Chalberg. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing

engagement by the Company. I will not, in connection with my consultancy with the Company, use or disclose to the Company any confidential, trade secret or other proprietary information of any previous employer or other person to which I am not
lawfully entitled. As a matter of record, I attach as Exhibit C of this Agreement a brief description of all Inventions made or conceived by me prior to my employment with the Company which I desire to be excluded from this Agreement
(&#147;<B>Background Technology</B>&#148;). I hereby grant Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable, worldwide right to use and sublicense the use of Background Technology for the purpose of developing, marketing, selling and
supporting Company technology, products and services, either directly or through multiple tiers of distribution, but not for the purpose of marketing Background Technology separately from Company products or services. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>4. NON-SOLICITATION.</B> During the term of my consultancy with the Company and for a period of one (1)&nbsp;year thereafter, I will not solicit or
encourage, or cause others to solicit or encourage, any employees of the Company to terminate their employment with the Company. During the term of my consultancy with the Company, I will not solicit the business of any customer or client of the
Company on my own behalf or on behalf of any person or entity other than the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>5. MISCELLANEOUS.</B> The parties&#146; rights and obligations
under this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors, heirs, executors, and administrators and permitted assigns. I will not assign this Agreement or its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of
the Company and any such purported assignment without consent shall be null and void from the beginning. I acknowledge that I am a party to the Employee Confidential Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement with Company, dated July&nbsp;15,
2014 (the &#147;Prior Agreement&#148;) , which agreement shall continue to survive my termination of employment with Company as of the date hereof. This Agreement and the Prior Agreement constitute the parties&#146; final, exclusive and complete
understanding and agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements relating to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be waived, modified or amended unless mutually
agreed upon in writing by both parties. In the event any provision of this Agreement is found to be legally unenforceable, such unenforceability shall not prevent enforcement of any other provision of the Agreement. I acknowledge that the Company
will suffer substantial damages not readily ascertainable or compensable in terms of money in the event of the breach of any of my obligations under this Agreement. I therefore agree that the Company shall be entitled (without limitation of any
other rights or remedies otherwise available to the Company) to obtain an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction prohibiting the continuance or recurrence of any breach of this Agreement. The rights and obligations of the parties under
this Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California exclusively, without regard to conflict of law provisions. I agree that upon Company&#146;s request, all disputes arising hereunder shall be adjudicated in the
state and federal courts having jurisdiction over disputes arising in San Francisco, California, and I hereby agree to consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. Any notices required or permitted hereunder shall be given to the

as chief executive officer (CEO) and president and as a member of the Board of Directors, effective July&nbsp;23, 2015. Avalanche&#146;s Board of Directors has appointed Hans P. Hull to serve as interim CEO and president. Previously CEO of Orthobond

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Avalanche is a leader in developing gene therapy products for eye diseases, and we are grateful to Tom, who co-founded the Company and has played an
instrumental role in Avalanche&#146;s progress, including steering the scientific development of the Ocular Biofactory&#153; technology platform and building a diverse pipeline with the potential to transform the standard of care across a number of
diseases in ophthalmology,&#148; said Dr.&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;S. Blumenkranz, co-founder and chairman of the Board. &#147;The Board is committed to finding the right CEO to lead Avalanche in its current evolution as a relatively new public company that
is developing multiple drug candidates. As part of these activities, we will also be conducting a search to expand and diversify the Company&#146;s Board of Directors.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Avalanche&#146;s Board of Directors has appointed independent directors John P. McLaughlin and Paul D. Wachter to a Special Committee to lead the search for a
permanent CEO and additional directors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;After nine years since co-founding the Company and serving as CEO, I am proud of the progress we&#146;ve
made,&#148; said Dr.&nbsp;Chalberg. &#147;I am ready to turn over the reins to a new leader, and look forward to supporting the Company in a new role going forward. I am deeply thankful for the opportunity to work alongside such an incredibly
talented group of colleagues on behalf of the millions of patients suffering from blinding and sight-threatening diseases.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, Avalanche
announced that co-founder Mitchell H. Finer, Ph.D., would be returning to the Company as a consultant in the role of Distinguished Research Fellow. Dr.&nbsp;Finer brings more than 25 years of experience in the gene therapy field, including most
recently as the Chief Scientific Officer of bluebird bio, Inc. In this role, Dr.&nbsp;Finer will help guide Avalanche&#146;s research programs and external collaborations, and brings a wealth of scientific knowledge to the Company. </P>
