Officers&#146; Certificate and Company Order, dated July&nbsp;23, 2015, pursuant to Section&nbsp;301 of the indenture (together, the &#147;Indenture&#148;) between the Company and the Trustee, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental

authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in initial aggregate principal amount to $750,000,000; <I>provided, however</I>, that the Company may, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes of this series, issue additional notes with the same terms as the Notes of this series, and such additional notes shall be considered part of the same series under the Indenture as the

year, and on the date of maturity, commencing October&nbsp;17, 2015, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. Each such January&nbsp;17, April&nbsp;17, July&nbsp;17 and October&nbsp;17 shall be an &#147;Interest Payment

which interest has been paid or provided for, to, but excluding, the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The Accrued Interest Factor for each day shall be computed by dividing the per annum interest rate applicable to such day by
