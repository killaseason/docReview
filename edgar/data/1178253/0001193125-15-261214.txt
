July&nbsp;21, 2015, SCYNEXIS, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) completed the sale of the Company&#146;s animal health, contract research and development services business (the &#147;Services Business&#148;) pursuant to an Asset
Purchase Agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;), dated July&nbsp;17, 2015, with Accuratus Lab Services, Inc. (the &#147;Buyer&#148;) a private-equity backed process chemistry, formulation, manufacturing and analytical development services provider,
for an aggregate purchase price of $3,875,000, subject to a pre-closing working capital adjustment of $824,064. In addition, a portion of the consideration payable at closing equal to $500,000 was withheld and is subject to an escrow for a period of
twelve (12)&nbsp;months from the date of close to satisfy indemnification obligations of the Company in connection with breaches of any representation and warranties and other customary obligations under the terms of the Agreement. In connection
with the sale of the Services Business, each of the Company&#146;s non-executive officer employees principally providing services to the Services Business have either accepted continued employment with the Buyer or has been terminated in connection
with the transaction contemplated by the Agreement. As a condition to the execution of the Agreement, Buyer is assuming the Company&#146;s post-closing obligation under its facility lease in Durham, North Carolina and the Company is being released
from any post-closing liability under the facility lease. The Company and its retained employees will continue to operate from the Durham facility immediately after the closing for a period of up to six months pursuant to a facility license and a
transition services agreement. The foregoing description of the Agreement and the transaction described here is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. </P>

Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September&nbsp;30, 2015. The purpose of this Services Agreement is to replace services that were previously provided internally by employees of the Company prior to the sale of the Services Business. The
employees performing these services became employees of the Buyer in connection with this sale transaction. While profit margin is included in the amount of the minimum purchase obligation above, such amount cannot be reasonably estimated. </P>

future business prospects, (viii)&nbsp;the Indemnitor conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently, and (ix)&nbsp;the Indemnitor keeps the Indemnitee apprised of all material developments, including settlement offers, with
respect to the Third Party Claim and permits the Indemnitee to participate, at its own expense, through counsel of the Indemnitee&#146;s choice, in the defense of the Third Party Claim. No Third Party Claim may be settled without the consent of the
Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. An Election to Defend constitutes an admission that such claim is within the scope of the Indemnitor&#146;s indemnification obligations hereunder. If the Indemnitor chooses not to
defend any Third Party Claim by failure to deliver on a timely basis the Election to Defend or by failure to meet the conditions specified above, the Indemnitee may defend against such Third Party Claim, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate, and solely if the Indemnitee proves its right for indemnification pursuant to Section&nbsp;7 also obtain indemnification pursuant to this Article 7 for
Losses resulting from such Third Party Claim. In addition, if the Indemnitor has assumed defense of the Third Party Claim and if a potential or actual conflict of interest shall exist or if different defenses shall be available between the
Indemnitor and the Indemnitee, then the Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain separate legal counsel and submit the fees and expenses of such counsel as part of a Demand pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee

any Third Party Claim, keep each other fully apprised as to the details and progress of all proceedings relating thereto and render to each other such assistance as may be reasonably required for the proper and adequate defense of any Third Party

conducted by an independent electrical engineering consultant and (ii)&nbsp;in the event Landlord exercises such right, Tenant covenants and agrees that an independent electrical engineering consultant shall make a survey of electric power demand of
the electric lighting fixtures and the electric equipment of Tenant used in the demised premises (and also taking into account and including the costs of such expenses for the common areas located on such floor which are attributable and allocated
by Landlord on an equitable basis to the demised premises) to determine the average monthly electric consumption thereof, and the cost of said survey shall be borne by Tenant, but shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The findings of
said consultant as to the average monthly electric consumption of Tenant shall, unless objected to by Tenant within ninety (90)&nbsp;days, be conclusive and binding on Landlord and Tenant. After Landlord&#146;s consultant has submitted its report,
subject to Tenant&#146;s right to dispute the same, the Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after demand therefor by Landlord, the amount (based on the monthly consumption found by such consultant) as owing thereafter (except
as otherwise specifically set forth herein) and such consultant&#146;s determination of Tenant&#146;s monthly consumption shall apply on a going-forward basis in lieu of the formula set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;4.02.(x)&#151;(z)</U>&nbsp;hereof.
Said amounts shall be treated as additional rent due hereunder. Proportionate sums shall be payable for periods of less than a full month if the Term commences or ends on any other than the first or last day of the month. If Tenant objects to said
findings, Tenant shall nevertheless pay and continue to pay the amount determined by Landlord&#146;s consultant until the issue is finally resolved, but Tenant may, at its expense, seek the services of an independent electrical consultant who shall
make a survey as provided above. If Landlord&#146;s and Tenant&#146;s consultant cannot agree as to Tenant&#146;s consumption within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of Tenant&#146;s consultant&#146;s findings, either Landlord or Tenant may request the
American Arbitration Association in Somerset, New Jersey to appoint an electrical engineering consultant whose decision shall be final and binding on Landlord and Tenant, and whose cost shall be shared equally. Upon the issue being finally resolved,
any overpayment made by Tenant shall be promptly refunded. Provided Tenant strictly complies with all applicable provisions of the Lease, including, but not limited to, <U>Articles 6, 7, 8 and 9</U> hereof, and further provided Tenant has not
breached any provision of the Lease (after receipt of any required written notice and beyond the expiration of any applicable cure period), Tenant, at its expense, may install in the demised premises a submeter to measure the demand for and
consumption of electricity for just the demised premises. If Tenant so installs such submeter, then, Tenant shall, subject to the immediately preceding sentence, simultaneously install a checkmeter to measure the demand for and consumption of
electricity in just the common areas of the floor on which the demised premises are located. Tenant, at its cost, shall be responsible for the installation, maintenance and repair of such submeter and checkmeter. Tenant shall pay Landlord upon its
demand for any billing period for electricity consumed in the common areas and consumed by Tenant in the demised premises an amount equal to 103% of the product of the Average Cost Per KWHR for such period multiplied by, in the case of the submeter,
Tenant&#146;s usage (&#147;<B><U>KWHR</U></B>&#148;) of electricity during such period as shown by the submeter (for the demised premises) and by, in the case of the checkmeter, the usage of electricity during such period as shown by the checkmeter

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>UNAUDITED CONDENSED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As disclosed within the Current Report on Form 8-K accompanying this exhibit, we have completed the sale of our contract research and
development services business (the &#147;Service Business&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The unaudited pro forma financial information herein provides the
financial condition and results of operations of SCYNEXIS, Inc. after giving effect to a sale of our service business. The Company expects to report the service business in discontinued operations within the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2015, pursuant to FASB Topic 205-20, Presentation of <I>Financial Statements&#151;Discontinued Operations</I>, and FASB Topic 360, <I>Property, Plant, and Equipment</I>. The historical financial information has been
adjusted to give effect to events that are directly attributable to a divestiture based on assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma financial information represents management&#146;s best estimate of the
Company&#146;s financial position and results of operations that would have been obtained had a divestiture been completed as of the date or for the periods presented, but may not necessarily be indicative of or comparable to the financial position
or results of operations that may be obtained in the future. The unaudited pro forma financial information excludes any transaction costs, transaction gains or losses, and any indirect costs related to employee severance, incentive compensation, and
other restructuring events. Further, the unaudited pro forma financial information excludes any obligations arising from or costs associated with the Commitment to Services Agreement, the material terms of which are described in Item&nbsp;1.01 of
the Current Report on Form 8-K accompanying this exhibit. The purpose of this Services Agreement is to replace services that were previously provided internally by employees of the Company prior to the sale of the Services Business, which are
included in research and development expenses within our historical statements of operations. The employees performing these services became employees of the Buyer in connection with this sale transaction. While profit margin is included in the
amount of the minimum purchase obligation above, such amount cannot be reasonably estimated; accordingly, any profit margin associated with the Services Agreement has not been included in accompanying unaudited condensed pro forma financial
information. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The unaudited condensed pro forma balance sheet has been prepared as of March&nbsp;31, 2015 and gives effect to the sale of
the service business as if it had occurred on that date. The unaudited condensed pro forma statements of operations have been prepared for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2015 and for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, and 2013, and give
effect to the sale of the service business as if it had occurred as of January&nbsp;1, 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, we have viewed and managed our
operations as a single, shared group of assets and resources that we have utilized to provide contract research and development services to customers and to advance our internal research and development efforts for the discovery and development of
proprietary and novel compounds. All of our activities have been conducted within a single facility, which we lease from a third-party landlord, and the majority of our property, plant, and equipment consist of leasehold improvements related to our
leased facility. We manage and allocate resources to support both our contract research and development service activities, from which we have derived substantially all of our revenues, and our internal research and development activities. Our
general and administrative expenses support all of our operating activities. In preparing the pro forma financial information herein, we adjusted our historical financial information to exclude all service revenues, and to exclude all expenses,
assets, and liabilities directly associated with the service business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The unaudited pro forma financial information herein has been
derived from and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of SCYNEXIS contained in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March&nbsp;31, 2015, filed with the SEC on May&nbsp;15, 2015, and in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, filed with the SEC on March&nbsp;30, 2015. </P>
