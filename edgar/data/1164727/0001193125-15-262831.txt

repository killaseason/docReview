the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled also to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such claim. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Directors who are not parties to such action, suit or
proceeding, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of or reimbursement or advancement of expenses to the claimant is
proper in the circumstances, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the
claimant is not entitled to indemnification or to the reimbursement or advancement of expenses, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant is not so entitled. </P>
