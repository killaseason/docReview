<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Loan and Security Agreement with Crystal Financial </U></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On
July&nbsp;22, 2015, Turtle Beach Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) and its subsidiaries Voyetra Turtle Beach, Inc. (&#147;Voyetra&#148; and together with the Company, the &#147;US Borrowers&#148;), Turtle Beach Europe Limited (the &#147;UK
Borrower&#148;, and together with the US Borrowers, the &#147;Borrowers&#148;) and VTB Holdings, Inc., as guarantor (&#147;VTBH&#148;), entered into a term loan, guaranty and security agreement (the &#147;Term Loan Agreement&#148;) with Crystal
Financial SPV LLC and the other persons party thereto as lenders (the &#147;Term Loan Lenders&#148;), and Crystal Financial LLC, as agent for the Term Loan Lenders (the &#147;Term Loan Agent&#148;), sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner. The Term
Loan Agreement provides for an aggregate term loan commitment of $15,000,000 which was fully funded on July&nbsp;22, 2015. The Company used $4,000,000 of the proceeds from the term loan to repay a portion of its outstanding subordinated notes, as
more fully described below. The remaining proceeds of the term loan will be used by the Company for general corporate purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term loan bears
interest at a rate per annum equal to the 90-day LIBOR rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal) plus 10.25%. The Company is required to make payments of interest in arrears on the first day of each month beginning August&nbsp;1, 2015 and will
repay the principal of the term loan in equal monthly payments of $187,500 beginning January&nbsp;1, 2016, with a final balloon payment on the stated maturity date of June&nbsp;28, 2019. The Company paid a commitment fee to the Term Loan Lenders of
$375,000 on the closing date of the Term Loan Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To secure their obligations under the Term Loan Agreement, the Company and each of its
subsidiaries granted a security interest in substantially all of their working capital assets to the Term Loan Agent. The security interest in favor of the Term Loan Agent is subject to the first-priority lien of Bank of America , N.A., as agent
(&#147;Bank of America&#148;), under the Company&#146;s asset-based revolving credit facility (the &#147;ABL Loan Agreement&#148;) with Bank of America and the other parties thereto, other than with respect to equipment, fixtures, real property
interests, intellectual property, intercompany indebtedness, equity interest in their subsidiaries, and certain other assets specified in an intercreditor agreement between Bank of America and the Term Loan Agent.&nbsp;The Obligations of the US
Borrowers are guaranteed by VTBH, and the obligations of the UK Borrower are guaranteed by the US Borrowers and VTBH. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company and its subsidiaries
are required to comply with various customary covenants set forth in the Term Loan Agreement, including, (i)&nbsp;maintaining minimum EBITDA and Headset EBITDA (each as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) in each trailing twelve month period
beginning August&nbsp;31, 2015, (ii)&nbsp;maintaining a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) to be measured on the last day of each month while the term loans are outstanding of no more than 5.75:1 beginning
December&nbsp;31, 2015 with periodic step-downs to 3.00:1 on January&nbsp;31, 2017, (iii)&nbsp;not making capital expenditures in excess of $11 million in the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2015 and in excess of $7 million in each of the years ending
December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, (iv)&nbsp;restrictions on the Company&#146;s and its subsidiaries ability to pay dividends, incur debt, create or suffer liens and engage in certain fundamental transactions and (v)&nbsp;an obligation to
provide the Term Loan Agent and the Term Loan Lenders with certain financial and other information. The Term Loan Agreement also restricts the Company&#146;s ability to prepay its subordinated notes, other than the $4,000,000 prepayment on the
closing date referred to above. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Term Loan Agreement contains customary representations, mandatory prepayment events and events of default, including,
defaults triggered by the failure to make payments when due, breaches of covenants and representations, material impairment in the perfection of the Term Loan Agent&#146;s security interest in the collateral and events related to bankruptcy and
insolvency of the Company and its subsidiaries. Upon an event of default, the Term Loan Agent and the Term Loan Lenders may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable (along with a prepayment fee), a default rate of an
additional 2.0% may be applied to amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement and the Term Loan Agent and the Term Loan Lenders may take other actions set forth in the Tern Loan Agreement, including collecting or taking such other action with
respect to the collateral pledged in connection with the term loan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the event all or a portion of the term loan is repaid prior to the date provided
in the Term Loan Agreement, a prepayment fee will be due to the Term Loan Lenders. The prepayment fee due to the Term Loan Lenders is equal to the greater of (a)&nbsp;the amount of unpaid interest that would otherwise have accrued and been due on
amounts repaid within the first 15 months following July&nbsp;22, 2015 and (b)&nbsp;during the first year of the term loan, an amount equal to 4.00% of the amounts repaid gradually decreasing to 0% after July&nbsp;22, 2018. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Term Loan Agreement permits certain equity holders of the Company to contribute funds to the Company to cure financial covenant defaults under the Term
Loan Agreement. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&nbsp;22, 2015, in connection with the Term Loan Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into a Fifth Amendment to the ABL Loan Agreement
(the &#145;Fifth Amendment&#148;) with the other parties thereto. The Fifth Amendment modified the borrowing base pursuant to which availability of loans under the ABL Loan Agreement is determined, provided for additional mandatory prepayment events
and modified certain covenants contained in the ABL Loan Agreement, including to permit the Company to enter into the Term Loan Agreement. In addition, the Fifth Amendment permits certain equity holders of the Company to contribute funds to the

Event</U>. In connection with a Merger Event that is a Liquid Sale, this Agreement shall, on and after the closing thereof, automatically and without further action on the part of any party or other person, represent the right to receive, in lieu of
the shares of Common Stock that are issuable hereunder as of immediately prior to the closing of such Merger Event, the consideration payable on or in respect of such shares of Common Stock less the Purchase Price for all such shares of Common Stock
(such consideration to include both the consideration payable at the closing of such Merger Event and all deferred consideration payable thereafter, if any, including, but not limited to, payments of amounts deposited at such closing into escrow and
payments in the nature of earn-outs, milestone payments or other performance-based payments), and such Merger Event consideration shall be paid to the Warrantholder as and when it is paid to the holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. In
connection with a Merger Event that is not a Liquid Sale, the Company shall cause the successor or surviving entity to assume this Agreement and the obligations of the Company hereunder on the closing thereof, and thereafter this Agreement shall be
exercisable for the same number and type of securities or other property as the Warrantholder would have received in consideration for the shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder had it exercised this Agreement in full as of immediately prior to
such closing, at an aggregate Exercise Price no greater than the aggregate Exercise Price in effect as of immediately prior to such closing, and subject to further adjustment from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The

rights under this Agreement exist into the same or a different number of securities of any other class or classes, this Agreement shall thereafter represent the right to acquire such number and kind of securities as would have been issuable as the
result of such change with respect to the securities which were subject to the purchase rights under this Agreement immediately prior to such combination, reclassification, exchange, subdivision or other change. The provisions of this
Section&nbsp;8(b) shall similarly apply to successive combination, reclassification, exchange, subdivision or other change. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c)

Stock issuable hereunder shall be proportionately increased, or (ii)&nbsp;in the case of a combination, the Exercise Price shall be proportionately increased and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder shall be proportionately
decreased. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(d) <U>Stock Dividends</U>. If the Company at any time while this Agreement is outstanding and unexpired shall: </P>

numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and (B)&nbsp;the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately

Because disputes arising in connection with complex financial transactions are most quickly and economically resolved by an experienced and expert person and the parties wish applicable state and federal laws to apply (rather than arbitration
rules), the parties desire that their disputes be resolved by a judge applying such applicable laws. EACH OF THE COMPANY AND WARRANTHOLDER SPECIFICALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM,
COUNTERCLAIM, THIRD PARTY CLAIM OR ANY OTHER CLAIM (COLLECTIVELY, &#147;<U>CLAIMS</U>&#148;) ASSERTED BY THE COMPANY AGAINST WARRANTHOLDER OR ITS ASSIGNEE OR BY WARRANTHOLDER OR ITS ASSIGNEE AGAINST THE COMPANY. This waiver extends to all such
Claims, including Claims that involve Persons other than Company and Warrantholder; Claims that arise out of or are in any way connected to the relationship between the Company and Warrantholder; and any Claims for damages, breach of contract,
specific performance, or any equitable or legal relief of any kind, arising out of this Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(o) <U>Prejudgment Relief</U>. In the
event Claims are to be resolved by arbitration, either party may seek from a court of competent jurisdiction identified in Section&nbsp;12(m), any prejudgment order, writ or other relief and have such prejudgment order, writ or other relief enforced
to the fullest extent permitted by law notwithstanding that all Claims are otherwise subject to resolution by judicial reference. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(p)

satisfaction of any condition in <B>Section&nbsp;6</B>, Agent may presume that the condition is satisfactory to a Secured Party unless Agent has received notice to the contrary from such Secured Party before Agent takes the action. Agent may request
instructions from the applicable Required Lenders or other Secured Parties with respect to any act (including the failure to act) in connection with any Loan Documents or Collateral, and may seek assurances to its satisfaction from Secured Parties
of their indemnification obligations against Claims that could be incurred by Agent. Agent may refrain from any act until it has received such instructions or assurances, and shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining.
Instructions of Required Lenders shall be binding upon all Secured Parties, and no Secured Party shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent acting or refraining from acting pursuant to instructions of Required
Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, instructions by and consent of specific parties shall be required to the extent provided in <B>Section&nbsp;14.1.1</B>. In no event shall Agent be required to take any action that it determines in its
