<b>FLIR Systems Announces Second Quarter 2015 Financial Results </b>
<p>Revenue and EPS Increase 6% and 16% Over the Prior Year, Respectively; Year to Date EPS Increases 35% Over the Prior Year</p>
<p>WILSONVILLE, OR -- (Marketwired - July      24, 2015) -  FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015. Revenue was $393 million, up 6% compared to second quarter 2014 revenue of $369.4 million. On a constant-currency basis, revenue for the second quarter was up 12% compared to the prior year, as foreign currency exchange fluctuations negatively impacted revenue by approximately $20 million. Operating income in the second quarter was $70.5 million, compared to $59.4 million in the second quarter of 2014. Operating income was impacted by pretax charges related to previously-announced restructuring initiatives of $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2014. Second quarter 2015 net income was $50.5 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared with net income of $44.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share in the second quarter a year ago. Net income was impacted by after-tax restructuring charges of $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $2.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2014. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter of 2015 was $48.9 million.
</p>
<p>
The Surveillance segment contributed $107.8 million of revenue during the second quarter, down 5% from the prior year. The Instruments segment had $90.3 million of revenue, up 7% versus the prior year, and was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange fluctuations by approximately $7 million. FLIR's OEM &amp; Emerging Markets segment recorded revenue of $46.3 million in the second quarter, down 9% from the prior year. Revenue from the Maritime segment was $52 million, down 6% from the second quarter of 2014, and was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange fluctuations by approximately $7 million. Security segment revenue was $60 million, an increase of 34% over the second quarter results last year. The Detection segment contributed $36.5 million of revenue, an increase of 77% from the prior year.
</p>
<p>
"With currency-neutral revenue growth of approximately 7% and EPS growth of 35%, we have been successful in executing on our strategies in the first half of 2015," said Andy Teich, President and CEO of FLIR. "Innovations in many of our commercial markets have driven broader adoption of our thermal and other sensing technologies. FLIR's commercially-developed, military qualified (CDMQ) model continues to be a positive differentiator in our government and military markets while our restructuring initiatives have proven very beneficial from a profitability standpoint. We look forward to continuing this momentum into the second half of 2015."
</p>
<p>
FLIR's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $536 million as of June 30, 2015, a decrease of $21 million, or 4%, during the quarter and a decrease of $12 million, or 2%, from the second quarter of 2014.
</p>
<p>
<b>Revenue and Earnings Outlook for 2015</b>
</p>
<p>
Based on financial results for the first half of 2015 and the outlook for the remainder of the year, FLIR continues to expect revenue for the full year 2015 to be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion and net earnings, excluding restructuring charges, to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dividend Declaration</b>
</p>
<p>
FLIR's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share on FLIR common stock, payable September 4, 2015, to shareholders of record as of close of business on August 21, 2015.
