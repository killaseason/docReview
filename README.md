# Some major issues I'd like to resolve, roughly in order of priority, are as follows:
# - Not running program on companies that are not publicly traded
# - Getting tickers for all companies that are publicly traded
# - Fixing identification of OTC companies (currently grabbing from exhibits beyond the first, which is picking up code)
# - Making sure that the 1-day change reported for all companies with tickers is the 1-day change from day before the offending filing, as opposed to the day before the run.
